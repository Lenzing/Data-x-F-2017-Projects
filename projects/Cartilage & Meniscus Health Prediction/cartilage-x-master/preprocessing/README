Cartilage flattening Matlab script

The main script is main.m

To run the C files from Matlab you should compile the C files.
The compilation is different depending on the operating system so make sure to do it separately on every machine you run the code:
Run in matlab: mex filename.c
Need to have a C compiler, if not available install the one that Matlab suggests
Creates a filename.mexw64 binary file that can be used as a normal matlab function
