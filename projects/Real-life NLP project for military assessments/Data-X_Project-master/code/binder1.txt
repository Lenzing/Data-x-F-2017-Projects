 Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 1-04, Legal Support to Operations, establishes Air Force doctrine focused on legal advice and considerations for Air Force operations.  The Air Force, like other Services, continues to operate in an increasingly complex environment around the world, demanding nothing less than the very best in legal capability.    This document represents best practices and other sanctioned ideas regarding legal aspects of Air Force operations across the range of military operations.    For over 60 years, the Air Force has possessed organic legal support in both the Office of the General Counsel and the Judge Advocate General (JAG) corps.  On 25 June 1948, the US Congress established the office of The Judge Advocate General (TJAG), and, a year later, the Air Force Chief of Staff designated Air Force officers—who are attorneys—to serve as JAGs.  In 2003, the JAG Department was renamed the “JAG corps” by order of the Secretary of the Air Force.   
 
 The Office of the Judge Advocate General (JA) and the Office of the Air Force General Counsel (GC) work together to serve the Department of the Air Force. The relationship between GC and JA is unique. Both the General Counsel and TJAG are legal advisers to the Secretary of the Air Force and Chief of Staff of the Air Force with right of independent access and independent legal advice to those officials. JA and GC work in a complementary manner on a wide variety of issues.  As such, this AFDD does not address the roles and responsibilities of GC, issues may arise in the field that fall in areas for which GC is responsible. 
 
 Legal support to Air Force commanders is critical to mission success.  They turn primarily to their JAGs for insight into the law and its impact on Air Force operations.  Proper legal counsel enhances commanders’ successful decision-making ability, aiding in mission success.

PREFACE 
 
 This AFDD focuses on fundamental principles, organization of legal support, and conduct of legal support operations by JAG corps personnel.   
 
 Chapter One, Judge Advocate General and Command Fundamentals, describes the power of command and fundamental Air Force legal aspects of command.  It also details the legal roles and responsibilities of the (COMAFFOR) to include:  mission accomplishment, compliance with the law, and maintenance of domestic and foreign contracts. 
 
 Chapter Two, Command and Organization of Air Force JAG Corps Support, introduces JAG corps organization including:  TJAG, the Air Force Legal Operations Agency (AFLOA), and Staff Judge Advocates (SJA).  It describes the integration of legal support into the air operations center divisions.   
 
Chapter Three, JAG Corps Support to Air Force Operations, describes how the Air Force conducts legal support operations.  It discusses legal considerations across the range of military operations, operations planning, Air Force legal readiness, mission readiness of JAG corps personnel, rules of engagement, and rules for the use of force. 
 
 Five appendices complement this AFDD by expanding concepts presented within the chapters.  These appendices provide additional legal considerations for Air Force operations, deliberate and crisis action planning, legal readiness considerations, rules of engagement, and US code sections. 
 
 This document applies to all Airmen. CHAPTER ONE 
 
JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL AND COMMAND FUNDAMENTALS  
 
 
“The High Contracting Parties at all times, and the parties to the conflict in time of armed conflict, shall ensure that legal advisers are available, when necessary, to advise military commanders at the appropriate level on the application of the conventions and this protocol and on the appropriate instruction to be given to the armed forces on this subject.” 
Geneva Additional Protocol I 
Article 82 
 
Although the US is not a party to Protocol 1, the US considers this to be a good practice. 

 
 This chapter discusses the power of command and fundamental Air Force legal aspects of command.  It also details the legal roles and responsibilities of the commander, Air Force forces (COMAFFOR) to include:  mission accomplishment, compliance with the law, and maintaining domestic and foreign contracts.  Because the COMAFFOR is normally dual-hatted as the joint or combined force air component commander (JFACC/CFACC), “the requirements and responsibilities of the COMAFFOR and JFACC/CFACC are inextricably linked”.1  However, this document is written specifically to inform the Air Force commander about the legal support available to him and will refer to the COMAFFOR, even in instances where that individual is also likely the JFACC/CFACC. 
1 See AFDD 1. 
 
THE POWER OF COMMAND 
 
 The COMAFFOR is responsible for ensuring that Air Force forces understand and comply with legal requirements.  The COMAFFOR’s staff judge advocate (SJA) is responsible for providing timely and effective legal advice to the COMAFFOR.  Effective discharge of this responsibility requires commanders to understand their legal responsibilities and the capabilities of an SJA.  The commander’s legal authority is derived from the Constitution and from statutes enacted by Congress.  The legal directives that provide for a commander’s authority are only part of the equation. 
 
 The power and responsibilities of command are  distinctive elements of military operations.  How commanders wield this power can determine success or failure of the mission according to the following principles: 
 
. Command is the responsibility of an individual, not a staff.  

. Command is exercised by virtue of the office and the assignment of officers holding military grades who are eligible by law to command.   

. A commander can exercise command authority through subordinate commanders.   

. Vice and deputy commanders have no command functions.  However, they assist the commander via planning, investigating, and providing recommendations. 

. Some command authorities may be delegated; however, the responsibilities of command may never be delegated.   


 The concept of command embodies two important functions.  First, it is the legal authority over people, including the power to discipline.  Second, command is the legal responsibility for assigned resources and mission accomplishment.   
 
COMAFFOR LEGAL ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
 
 The role of a commander is unlike any position found in the civilian world, and unlike almost any other found in government.  A COMAFFOR not only has the legal authority to perform various roles and responsibilities, but also has the corresponding legal obligation to meet requirements defined by their roles and responsibilities.  Accordingly, commanders are accountable for the following:  
 
. Mission accomplishment. 

. Compliance with the law, to include: 

. .  US law. 

. .  Local or host-nation law, when required. 

. .  International law, as appropriate. 

. Maintaining domestic and foreign contracts (as required for mission accomplishment). 


Mission Accomplishment  
 A COMAFFOR’s foremost legal responsibilities are to follow the orders of their superior joint force commander (JFC) and accomplish the assigned mission or task.  The COMAFFOR’s immediate task is to organize, and when directed, employ an effective fighting force responsive to orders in a disciplined and effective manner. 
 
Compliance with the Law  
Public confidence in the military is maintained and strengthened by Airmen, particularly commanders, performing their responsibilities in a manner that is objective, fact-based, non-partisan, and non-ideological.  A commander’s credibility is based on objectivity in discharging his or her responsibilities.  The continued viability of the commander’s legal authority, particularly the authority to maintain good order and discipline, depends upon public and US government belief that commanders can be fair and objective.  Objectivity includes the perception of independence:  Maintaining impartiality, having intellectual honesty, and remaining free of conflicts of interest.  Maintaining objectivity includes a continuing assessment of relationships, particularly with private entities, in the context of a commander’s responsibility to the public. 
 
United States Law  
 
 Every Airman makes a solemn promise to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and bear true faith and allegiance to the same.”  Commanders bear the burden of ensuring Air Force personnel comply with US law.  It is their responsibility to ensure good order and discipline.  George Washington once stated, “Discipline is the soul of the Army.”  The original, and still most important, SJA mission is supporting the commander in administering good order and discipline.  Effective command and control of a force can only be exercised if that force maintains good order and discipline. 
 
Local or Host-Nation Law  
  
 In many cases, the Air Force is not directly bound by local or host-nation laws.  In the US, many state laws do not bind the Air Force since it is a federal entity.  In the overseas environment, the Air Force is often not bound by host-nation law due to basing agreements or status of forces agreements (SOFAs) allowing Air Force operations.   
 
 It is important for the commander and local authorities to fully understand the extent to which the Air Force is bound by any host-nation law.  A further challenge is ensuring individual Airmen comply with host-nation or state law.  Whereas the Air Force as an entity may not have to comply, there is a much greater chance that individual Airmen will be expected to comply with local law.  Here the commander has a critical role to ensure local authorities are respected to the maximum extent possible, while maintaining fair treatment of Airmen.  JAGs provide advice on local and host-nation law.  When compliance issues arise, they negotiate with local and state authorities on a commander’s behalf. 
 
International Law  
  
 International law is a highly complex aspect of international relations that is becoming increasingly important in the context of military operations.  Some aspects of international law are well known to the commander, such as the law of armed conflict (LOAC).  Others may not be well known, such as the concept of international human rights.  JAG training results in a basic understanding of international law.  The SJA maintains a group of JAGs who are specially trained to provide advice and support to the commander on applicable international law issues.    
Maintaining Domestic and Foreign Contracts  
 Contracting (with non-military organizations) is often required for mission accomplishment.  While there are mechanisms in place for subordinate personnel to work the processes to commission and manage contracts, the contracting officer is primarily responsible for advising the commander on contracting issues.  Many contracts between the Air Force and non-military organizations are complex.  JAGs can provide the understanding commanders require in the highly regulated realm of contracting relationships (both domestic and foreign).  The commander’s actual legal authority may not be commensurate with his perceived responsibility to maintain or develop a contract.  For accurate understanding of contractual obligations and responsibilities, commanders should consult their JAGs.  
 
 
CHAPTER TWO 
 
COMMAND AND ORGANIZATION OF JAG CORPS SUPPORT 
  
 
JAG CORPS MISSION  
Under the direction of The Judge Advocate General, the JAG Corps delivers professional, candid, independent counsel and full-spectrum legal capabilities to command and the warfighter. 
 
JAG CORPS VISION  
Enabling the Air Force and the warfighter through mission-focused legal capabilities honed for a dynamic environment. 

  
This chapter describes the Air Force JAG organizational structure and JAG Corps organization including:  The Judge Advocate General (TJAG), the Air Force Legal Operations Agency (AFLOA), and SJA.  It describes the integration of legal support into the Air Operations Center (AOC). 
 
JAG CORPS ORGANIZATION  
 
The Judge Advocate General  
  
Under federal law, TJAG is the legal advisor to the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF), the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF), and all officers and agencies of the Department of the Air Force.  TJAG directs Air Force JAGs and paralegals in the performance of their duties.  
 
Federal law also provides that no officer or employee of the Department of Defense may interfere with: 
 
. The ability of TJAG to give independent legal advice to the SECAF or CSAF. 

. The ability of JAGs assigned or attached to, or performing duty with, military units to give independent legal advice to commanders. 


The Air Force JAG Corps organization includes the following personnel:  
  
. TJAG and Deputy Judge Advocate General (DJAG).  

. All other Air Force officers designated as JAGs. 

. Airmen in the paralegal services career field and those assigned duties in JAG offices at any level of command. 

. Civilian attorneys and legal services civilians supporting the JAG Corps mission. . Air Force Reserve Component officers designated as JAGs. 

. Air Force Reserve Component enlisted personnel in the paralegal services career field and those assigned duties in JAG offices at any level of command. 


Commanders should note that, despite any temporary duties a JAG may be assigned, they retain their status as a JAG Corps member.    
 
Air Force Legal Operations Agency  
 AFLOA is a field-operating agency comprised of more than 800 military and civilian attorneys, paralegals, and support personnel worldwide.  AFLOA provides TJAG with civil, commercial, and criminal law expertise and litigation support, as well as legal education and cutting-edge technological assets.  The divisions of AFLOA, including the JAG School and the JAG corps field support centers (FSCs), provide direct legal services and support throughout the Air Force.  The AFLOA commander ensures that FSCs regularly communicate with SJAs to maintain effective lines of communication and ensure support to field commanders. 
 
Staff Judge Advocates  
 The SJA is the senior JAG assigned to provide legal advice to a court-martial convening authority (the Air Force commander with authority to convene general or special courts-martial).  The convening authority is typically exercised by the installation or host unit commander.  SJAs also provide legal advice and services to commanders of tenant units served by the host unit.  The principal responsibility of the SJA is to provide full-spectrum legal services required by commanders and their staffs.   
 
 By law, commanders responsible for convening courts-martial should at all times communicate directly with the SJA in matters relating to the administration of military justice.  By law, SJAs are authorized to communicate directly with the SJA of a superior or subordinate command or with TJAG.  No officer or employee of the Department of Defense (DOD) may interfere with the ability of JAGs to give independent legal advice. 
 
Field Support Centers 
 
 FSCs are TJAG’s primary vehicle for providing legal reachback support to field commanders through their SJA and JAG corps.  FSCs provide added legal expertise concerning a particular legal issue by coordinating with, and acting through, a commander's SJA.  As the commander's single focal point for all legal services, the SJA is solely responsible for identifying when a particular legal issue merits the additional legal expertise an FSC provides.  If warranted, an SJA may seek FSC expertise in areas such as aircraft investigations, claims, government contracts, and environmental issues or labor issues. 
 
 STAFF JUDGE ADVOCATE TO THE COMAFFOR ORGANIZATION 
 
 The COMAFFOR has several staff activities that fulfill specific responsibilities.   These activities are usually related to providing close, personal advice or services to the commander, or assisting the commander and the component staff with technical, administrative, or tactical matters.  The COMAFFOR’s SJA provides the full spectrum of legal services and advice to the COMAFFOR and Air Force forces (AFFOR) staff.   
 
 JAGs and paralegals focus on legal issues affecting the COMAFFOR’s ability to provide mission-ready air, space, and cyberspace capabilities, such as those relating to the planning; deployment; reception, staging, onward movement and integration; sustainment; and redeployment of forces.  With assistance from JAGs and paralegals, the COMAFFOR establishes and maintains good order and discipline for all members assigned or attached to an air expeditionary task force (AETF).  The AFFOR SJA provides guidance and managerial oversight to all subordinate JAGs and paralegals.   
 
 The AFFOR staff (also called the “A-staff”) and the air operations center (AOC) have distinctly separate duties.  Therefore, the AFFOR JAG corps personnel should not be dual-hatted as legal advisors to the COMAFFOR and AOC.  Ideally, the AFFOR JAG and paralegals liaise with AOC JAG corps personnel on LOAC and rules of engagement (ROE) issues.   
 
SJA duties to the COMAFFOR include the responsibilities to: 
 
. Assess the impact of US laws, host-nation laws, and international agreements on the actions and planning of US and coalition forces (e.g., overflight issues, beddown, host-nation support, environmental laws, foreign criminal jurisdiction, legal status of multinational, and US personnel).  

. Assess the impact of international law (especially LOAC) and customary practices, on operations and personnel (e.g., status of civilians, contractors, detainees, and asylum seekers). 

. Provide assessment and guidance on command relationships.  

. Assess the impact of fiscal and contracting authorities on operations.  

. Advise the commander on how to appropriately maintain good order and discipline.   

. Advise the COMAFFOR, AFFOR staff, and subordinate JAG offices on issues involving claims under either US law and directives or applicable international agreements and customary practice (e.g., recompense, claims for property damage, personal injury, or death). 

. Advise the COMAFFOR and subordinate legal offices on the type, nature, and procedural requirements of investigations (e.g., criminal investigations, accident investigations, and friendly fire investigations).  . Advise the COMAFFOR, AFFOR staff, and subordinate JAG offices on general legal issues related to combat support (e.g., ethics, foreign gifts, legal assistance, support to the Army and Air Force Exchange Service).  

. Advise the COMAFFOR, AFFOR staff, and subordinate JAG offices on issues regarding civil-military operations.  

. Assess law and policy governing domestic use of force and homeland security. 

. Assess and advise the COMAFFOR on the availability and applicability of legal authorities and funding to support security cooperation activities with partner nations. 


Organization and Manpower  
Manning is based upon the expectation of full-time support and advice to the COMAFFOR, AFFOR staff, and subordinate JAG offices.  The organization of the COMAFFOR’s JAG staff varies based on the scope of the operation and the number of subordinate forces.  The COMAFFOR’s SJA determines the best way to organize subordinate JAGs and paralegals.  A common practice is to organize by subject matter areas (e.g., military justice, international law, fiscal law, civil law, and claims).  The SJA is responsible for identifying JAG corps personnel manning requirements for subordinate AFFOR units.   
 
COMAFFOR JAG corps personnel manning should be tailored appropriate to the operation with the goal of minimizing the forward footprint.  Reachback and distributed staff capabilities should be considered when determining manning requirements.  It also helps to ensure appropriate guidance and oversight is available for subordinate JAGs and paralegals.  One known best practice is to select individuals with subject matter expertise in areas such as fiscal law/contracting, international law, military justice, and operational law.  The staffing of subordinate units varies based on the mission and size of the subordinate unit being considered.  A team of JAGs and paralegals with an appropriate mix of experience and training is desired.2   
2 For example, an appropriate mix of experience and training may include a combination of fiscal law, contingency contracting, operations law, theater-specific training, accident investigation training, wartime planning, homeland defense, claims, contingency skills training, and the law of war.  
 
 
Primary Functions and Capabilities  
 JAGs and paralegals also contribute their expertise to air component planners in areas of domestic, foreign, and international law that directly affect the conduct of air, space, and cyberspace operations.  To meet this challenge, JAGs and paralegals should also have the relevant knowledge, experience, access, and training to function within a joint or multinational environment.  Such training might include instruction about the laws governing air and space navigation, the rules governing the use of force, LOAC application, the targeting process, and joint operations planning. 
 INTEGRATION OF LEGAL SUPPORT IN THE AOC 
 
 JAGs and paralegals are usually integrated into the various divisions and cells within an AOC.  Legal support to an AOC is categorized as a specialty team designed to assist the AOC commander and all AOC divisions.  In addition, legal support is provided to assist special functions within a core team such as targeting and rules of engagement cells.  As a specialty team, JAGs and paralegals are not directly assigned or dedicated to support a particular division, but are available to support demands from the entire organization. 
 
 The COMAFFOR should ensure their JAGs and paralegals are made part of the joint legal staff and the level of legal support meets the requirements of the AOC commander and the JFACC/CFACC if the COMAFFOR is so dual-hatted.  The nature and scope of air operations, the operations tempo within the AOC, and the requirements of the supported commander normally determine JAG and paralegal resources given to the AOC.   
 
 Legal support in an AOC is provided by JAGs and paralegals with training and security clearances commensurate with their duties.  Paralegals assist JAGs in identifying legal issues and supporting functions and processes within an AOC, but only a JAG may provide legal advice or render a legal opinion.  While the internal organization of an AOC will vary, paralegals provide services to enhance the mission of the AOC, and JAGs provide advice to lawfully achieve mission objectives. 
 
Strategy Division  
 JAGs and paralegals assist the strategy division by evaluating legal issues raised by the operational environment and the objectives of the supported commander.  Within the strategy division, JAGs and paralegals concentrate on long-range planning to support the development, refinement, dissemination, and assessment of the COMAFFOR's plans and operations in support of the JFC’s strategy, and the joint air operations plan (JAOP).  When supporting the strategy division, JAGs and paralegals focus on long-range planning and execution rather than on the details of day-to-day operations.  JAGs and paralegals give tailored legal services to support the planning requirements of the strategy division. 
 
 As the JAOP is developed and objectives are identified, JAGs and paralegals review mission objectives found in the strategy and identify legal constraints that may restrict or prevent certain courses of action.  JAGs assess the intent of the commander, analyze the proposed course of action in light of the limitations and constraints found in law, policy, or other guidance, and advise the commander on the lawfulness of each course of action.  The primary role of the JAG is to ensure the proposed strategy, including branches and sequels, is consistent with the law, policy, and orders from commanders that govern the operation and to address any legal constraints that may affect joint or coalition forces.  
 Combat Plans Division  
 JAGs and paralegals provide commanders assistance in developing legally acceptable plans and orders that support the JAOP and the guidance issued by the JFC.  Within the combat plans division, JAGs facilitate the conversion of strategic guidance into executable plans and orders. 
 
 JAGs and paralegals participate in a recurring planning process to assist commanders in identifying, prioritizing, and selecting specific tasks to be accomplished and targets to be engaged with available resources.  In this capacity, JAGs advise personnel who produce the following:  targeting effects, master air attack plan (MAAP), air tasking order (ATO), and airspace control order (ACO).  JAGs and paralegals participate in target list development, production of the MAAP, drafting special instructions, and publishing the ACO and the final daily ATO.   
 
 All proposed tactics, targets engaged, and weapons employed  are reviewed by JAGs as requested.  Their review focuses on operational compliance with international law, domestic law, and applicable national policy.  JAGs focus on ensuring tactics, target engagement, and weapons employment are consistent with the LOAC and ROE. For example, a JAG may serve on a joint targeting coordination board or advise a commander on the requirements to protect cultural property and to minimize collateral damage during an air strike.  Although the ultimate decision whether to strike a target rests with the commander, JAGs often review proposed targets and identify legal considerations. 
 
Combat Operations Division  
 Within the combat operations division, JAGs and paralegals concentrate on evaluating the legality of employment options designed to support the overall assigned objectives.  Accordingly, JAGs provide legal advice concerning personnel recovery operations and attacks on dynamic targets.  For example, when attacking dynamic targets, a JAG considers factors including the sufficiency and accuracy of target data, the requirements of the LOAC, compliance with the ROE, and safeguards against fratricide.  Commanders should fully integrate JAGs and paralegals into combat operations processes so that orders will not unnecessarily restrict lawful actions or inadvertently permit unlawful activities. 
 
 JAGs and paralegals should maintain situational awareness to identify legal issues resulting from the execution of planned or time-sensitive operations.  JAGs monitor and evaluate tactics, technology, capabilities, or other conditions to identify legal issues that may impact an operation.  They recommend commanders modify, or forward a request to modify, the ROE when conditions or circumstances warrant changes to those rules.  JAGs and paralegals give advice on the changing nature of operations during execution with the goal of ensuring the legal integrity of military operations.  JAGs and paralegals that are properly integrated within the combat operations division are in the best position to understand and identify legal issues that may affect an operation.  They remain available to provide immediate legal advice on targets of opportunity and other dynamic operational requirements.  
 
 Because of the urgent nature of dynamic targets, JAGs provide critical legal advice immediately.  Moreover, JAGs and paralegals should be forward-thinking, anticipating potential legal issues for time-sensitive targets.  Commanders should be prepared to seek legal advice if conditions change during air operations.  JAGs and paralegals assess targets and form sound legal opinions based on national and other policy, the ROE, and the LOAC to support the commander’s objectives. 
 
 When potential LOAC violations or instances of fratricide occur, one of two things take place: after mission execution, JAGs and paralegals review battle damage assessment information; and if commander directed, JAG staff initiate or assist in investigations.  If a potential LOAC violation or instance of fratricide has occurred, has been reported, or is suspected, commanders should immediately involve their JAGs and paralegals.  JAGs and paralegals must also report LOAC violations and instances of fratricide through the operational chain of command and take legal action to preserve evidence and information to support future investigations or inquiries.  
 
Air Mobility Division  
Within the AMD, JAG corps personnel advise on actions taken to plan, coordinate, task, and execute air mobility operations in support of a larger operation.  For example, JAGs may advise the air mobility control team on interpretations of international agreements, risk to ground objects from airdrop, overflight rights, and landing rights.  
CHAPTER THREE 
 
JAG CORPS SUPPORT TO AIR FORCE OPERATIONS   
 
 
“The truth of the matter is that you always know the right thing to do.  The hard part is doing it.” 
—Norman Schwarzkopf  
 

 
This chapter describes how the Air Force JAG Corps conducts legal support to operations.  It discusses legal considerations across the range of military operations, operations planning, Air Force legal readiness, mission readiness of JAG Corps personnel, rules of engagement considerations, and rules for the use of force considerations. 
 
JAG CORPS SUPPORT  
 
 Air Force JAGs support all Air Force operations.  However, some Air Force operations deserve special legal attention including:  command and control (C2), air warfare; operations in an irregular warfare (IW) environment; cyberspace operations; air mobility operations; space operations; special operations; homeland operations; information operations (IO); intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); rescue operations; agile combat support; and Air Reserve considerations. 
 
Command and Control  
C2 are not only doctrinal concepts, but are also based on legal requirements and authorities.  Command is the lawful authority of the commander derived from the Constitution and from statutes enacted by Congress.  Control is the regulation of forces and functions to accomplish the mission in accordance with the commander’s intent (including Presidential and Secretary of Defense [SecDef] intent).  Combatant commanders (CCDRs) are tasked by law to employ forces.  In contrast, Service chiefs are tasked to organize, train, and equip US military forces.  As these differing responsibilities require different command relationships and levels of authority, the need to understand legal requirements and authorities becomes increasingly important.   
 
Because command authorities can be expressly created by statute, some agencies have unique command arrangements involving “dual-purpose” forces, such as to the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency.  “Dual-purpose” forces are funded and controlled by organizations that derive authority under laws contained in Title 10 and Title 50, United States Code (U.S.C.).  See Appendix E for an explanation of U.S. Code.  The greatest benefit of "dual-purpose" forces is their authority to operate under laws contained in Title 50 while being employed by combatant commanders, at the same time, using their Title 10 authority.  JAG consultation facilitates operations within dual statutory constructs.   
 Air Warfare 
Virtually all aspects of air warfare have legal considerations.  Attacks may be restricted by political considerations, military risk, as well as by international law, the LOAC, and ROE.  Counterair, strategic attack, counterland, countersea, and personnel recovery operations all are affected by international and host-nation law, particularly the laws governing the sovereignty of a country’s land, maritime, and air boundaries.  Counter-chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear operations raise serious implications regarding the lawful use of weapons under the LOAC, as well as US obligations under international arms control treaties.  JAG corps personnel have a vital role in training personnel and advising commanders on the legal aspects of targeting.  The SJA to the COMAFFOR provides a dedicated legal staff to this practice.  JAGs give advice to the warfighter on the legal aspects of targeting.3

4 JP 1 Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United States 
 
Operations in an Irregular Warfare Environment  
Irregular warfare (IW) is defined as “a violent struggle among state and non-state actors for legitimacy and influence over the relevant populations. IW favors indirect and asymmetric approaches, though it may employ the full range of military and other capacities, in order to erode an adversary's power, influence, and will”4.  The ROE for activities conducted in an IW environment are often constrained, due to the political and social sensitivities involved when the population, not the military, is the center of gravity. In irregular operations, contingencies can develop rapidly and in non-traditional locations; therefore, long-standing status-of-forces agreements (SOFAs) frequently do not exist. Legal constraints on the use of US funds, equipment, and supplies in support of non-US personnel may be complicated. Other legal challenges may include contingency contracting, the use of non-standard materiel, and the employment of local labor.  
 
Since US strategy is to assist partner nations in building their own security capabilities so they are better able to defend themselves, indirect IW approaches are becoming more widespread.  The SJA to the AFFOR plays a critical role in the planning and execution of indirect IW activities by ensuring that the proper legal authorities and funding are available and identified for all security cooperation assistance, both materiel and non-material, provided to partner nations by US forces.  If operations progress from indirect support and direct support (not including combat) to direct support (including combat), commanders should anticipate ROE adjustments. In addition, operations conducted in close proximity to civilians may present LOAC and ROE challenges. Commanders should be aware of the potential of rapidly changing ROE and the need to inform subordinates as these changes occur.  Understanding commander’s intent and ROE can reduce the chances of tactical errors, which can result in strategic setbacks. See AFDD 3-24, Irregular Warfare. 
 
Cyberspace Operations 
Domestic and international legal considerations affect virtually every aspect of cyberspace operations.  These may involve clarifying who has the authority to conduct what type of operation in cyberspace.  It is important to ascertain whether a proposed activity or operation falls within the assigned mission of an Air Force organization. Further, a particular proposed activity or operation may implicate domestic legal issues such as Fourth Amendment rights, statutes designed to protect privacy or those statutes prohibiting misuse of or interference with satellites or other communications systems. Proposed cyberspace operations should also be reviewed for compliance with applicable international law including LOAC.  Moreover, some particularly sensitive aspects of operations in cyberspace fall within the purview of the national intelligence community or other interagency members.  JAGs should seek additional legal support as necessary by exercising reachback to appropriate headquarters Air Force (HAF) legal offices.  See AFDD 3-12, Cyberspace Operations. 
 
Air Mobility Operations 
 Since air mobility operations cover the globe, a broad range of legal issues arise during normal operations.  Support from host nations involved in any air mobility operation is essential.  Host-nation support is needed to ensure fuel availability for air mobility aircraft.  It is paramount to obtain diplomatic clearances from a host nation for both overflight and landing.  Past conflicts have demonstrated the ability, or lack thereof, to obtain diplomatic clearances has far-reaching impacts on air mobility efforts.  Failure to adequately ascertain host-nation support and provide for any required augmentation can result in mission failure.     
 
JAGs help determine whether a SOFA or other agreements regarding US military presence in the host nation are in effect.  If no SOFA or other agreement exists, and legal analysis of the situation/operation proves necessary, proceed in accordance with DOD Directive (DODD) 5530.3, International Agreements, and Air Force Instruction (AFI) 51-701, Negotiating, Concluding, Reporting, and Maintaining International Agreements, for direction on how to proceed.  SOFAs normally include status of personnel, operating rights and responsibilities, possible exemption from landing fees, duties, taxes, boarding/inspection of military aircraft, or personnel entry requirements.  Waiver of inspection and boarding of aircraft is essential to maintaining the sovereignty of US military aircraft.  Additionally, if agreements are not understood or adhered to by personnel, mission failure is possible.  See AFDD 3-17, Air Mobility Operations.   
 
Space Operations 
The SJA maintains a cadre of JAGs specially trained in air and space law who understand the treaty, policy, and legal considerations associated with space operations.  See AFDD 3-14, Space Operations. 
 
Special Operations 
Planning and execution of special operations may raise legal issues, including LOAC, use of force, fiscal law, environmental law, international agreements, and other 
legal considerations.  The key to avoiding legal obstacles to mission accomplishment is early identification and resolution of potential legal issues before they affect mission success rates.  Air Force SOF commanders should ensure qualified legal support is integrated into mission planning, ROE development and publication, aircrew and operator training, and actual mission execution.  See AFDD 3-05, Special Operations. 
 
Homeland Operations  
There are general considerations to legal support regarding homeland operations and the law including financial reimbursement to the DOD.  
 
Any use of DOD assets to collect intelligence on US persons should be in accordance with DODD 5240.1-R, Procedures Governing the Activities of DOD Intelligence Components that Affect United States Persons. The Posse Comitatus Act (18 U.S.C. §1385) prohibits using members of the Army and Air Force to execute laws in the civilian community, except when authorized by the Constitution or by act of Congress. Congress has passed numerous exceptions to the prohibition. Some examples include the President’s ability to invoke the Enforcement of the Laws to Restore Public Order Act (formerly the Insurrection Act), and legislation permitting some use of the military in direct law enforcement roles to counter the influx of illegal narcotics. The exceptions, together with the President’s inherent authority under the Constitution, lead to the conclusion that Posse Comitatus does not constitute an insurmountable impediment to the appropriate use of US military resources in support of homeland operations.   
 
When managing the consequences of an event, states normally exercise primacy over domestic incidents.  Only when states request federal assistance (or in extraordinary circumstances) does the federal government normally get involved.  The request process is a key step for DOD because a formal request by the state followed by Presidential approval is necessary for a military Service to receive financial reimbursement.5   
5 More information can be found in the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 5121 et seq.). 
 
Because of legal and policy complexities, prompt and frequent consultations with military legal experts are among the most important considerations in planning for and employing military assets in the homeland environment.  See AFDD 3-27, Homeland Operations. 
 
Information Operations  
There are basic legal considerations that should be taken into account during all aspects of IO planning and execution.  JAGs are available at all levels of command in order to assist with these legal considerations.  See AFDD 3-13, Information Operations. 
 Intelligence, Surveillance, And Reconnaissance  
There are numerous legal issues associated with ISR, especially if ISR operations might impact US persons.  ISR activities should be coordinated with JAGs and paralegals to ensure compliance with the law and any existing ROE, as technological advances create numerous legal challenges.  Manned and unmanned aircraft will continue to be subject to host-nation overflight and access restrictions in an area of responsibility (AOR).  Those limitations are based on international law, custom and practice, and arrangements outlined in the DOD Foreign Clearance Guide.  See AFDD 2-0, Global Integrated Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Operations. 
 
Rescue Operations  
JAG personnel provide legal advice to commanders on all aspects of air and ground rescue operations inside and outside the Air Force.  Rescue operations consist of a number of specific tasks performed by Air Force units to recover isolated personnel.  These operations may be performed in peacetime and wartime throughout the entire spectrum of peaceful and non-peaceful means with a high probability they will be conducted in a joint environment.  Due to the quick actions needed to successfully perform rescue operations, JAG personnel familiar with these operations should be readily available to advise commanders and be involved from the beginning of rescue planning activities to the reintegration of recovered personnel.  For additional information, see AFDD 3-50, Personnel Recovery Operations. 
 
Agile Combat Support 
JAG corps personnel provide legal advice to commanders on all areas of combat support to include budget, personnel, military justice, claims, SOFA, international agreements, contracting actions, and specialized support in multinational, civil-military, and combat operations.  The JAG provides services that maximize the legal readiness of the force on both organizational and personal levels.  See AFDD 4-0, Agile Combat Support.  
 
Air Reserve Component (ARC) Considerations  
 Special considerations exist in determining the command relationships when dealing with the Air National Guard (ANG) and the Air National Guard of the United States (when federalized).6  The commander exercises command over applicable ANG units and members when they are federalized and in Title 10 status.  Administrative control (ADCON) for these federalized units is retained by the ANG Readiness Center.  If full mobilization has occurred, command authority is given to the gaining commander.  ANG units operating outside of the US or performing federal missions must be in Title 10 status.  When ANG personnel are involved in training for a federal mission (Title 32 status), the operational commander may exercise training and readiness oversight, but 
6 Because both state Air National Guard and the Air National Guard of the United States relatively go hand-in-hand, they are both usually referred to as just Air National Guard (ANG). 
does not possess command authority.  In this case, command authority remains with the state authorities.  Title 32 status ANG members fall under the command authority of the adjutant general (TAG) of their state, and therefore their governor.  If ANG members operate in Title 32 status outside of their state, but within the US, command authority remains with the TAG, but is subject to any coordinating authority or state-to-state agreements.  If no pre-negotiated agreement exists, responsibilities such as support and force protection are normally coordinated between applicable commanders. 
 
Similar considerations apply when dealing with the Air Force Reserve (AFR) forces.  AFR forces train and operate in a federal status under Title 10.  They are similar to ANG forces in being a part-time force, in that they are not continually in an active duty status, but they are subject to the UCMJ when performing official duties.  The ARC forces (which by statute include the ANG and the AFR) must be called to active duty as volunteers or involuntarily under specific statutory authority.  AFR forces are commanded by the commander of Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC/CC).  The AFRC/CC exercises command of AFRC units and members when they are in a military status.  ADCON for these federalized units is retained by the AFRC/CC in all locations short of full mobilization.  When AFR forces are involved in training, and not actually engaged in combatant commander (CCDR) operations, the operational commander normally exercises training and readiness oversight.7  All ARC forces are only called to duty for specific periods of time. Care must be taken that their military status is lawfully maintained if it becomes necessary to extend their term of service. 
7 More information about ARC use can be found in the current Global Force Management Implementation Guidance. 
 
 
AIR FORCE LEGAL READINESS  
 
Air Force legal readiness is the state of preparation in which Air Force members are ready to deploy, both in their personal and mission capacities.  Legal readiness involves awareness of the personal legal issues that may arise in preparation for or during a deployment and the remedies available to avoid or mitigate any adverse effects of those issues.  Regarding the mission, legal readiness involves the ability of individuals and their organizations to deal with the legal aspects of the operational environment.   
 
Legal readiness has many facets:  pre-deployment targeted legal advice, special and general powers of attorney, will and trust reviews, and general military legal counsel.  Appendix A offers the commander additional legal readiness considerations. 
 
 
MISSION READINESS OF JAG CORPS PERSONNEL  
  
 The mission requirements of a location determine legal services needs.  To achieve the level of JAG mission readiness needed, SJAs should first determine what is required to: support operations controlled, supported, or executed at or from the home station; prepare expeditionary legal support capabilities that are postured within their offices; and prepare to integrate legal support personnel identified to augment their offices.  Therefore, the mission readiness of any JAG activity should be evaluated in terms of home station operations, expeditionary legal support, and home station augmentation.  
 
Expeditionary Legal Support  
Expeditionary legal support includes the services provided to support forward-deployed forces.  Expeditionary legal support consists of the personnel and equipment available to satisfy expeditionary requirements.  This requires SJAs to understand their deployment contribution and availability.  Expeditionary legal support also includes legal services provided through reachback.  Reachback requires that home station resources (e.g., experts in various fields of practice, host-nation advisors, information, equipment) be prepared and available to support forward-deployed forces through the chain of command.   
 
Essential Level of Services and Contingency Mitigation Planning 
Each JAG activity determines the essential level of services to fulfill mission requirements by taking mission essential tasks and mandatory performance standards into account.  Therefore, SJAs should closely monitor the essential levels of service provided by their activity.  They need to plan accordingly for potential changes (possibly caused by deployments or emergencies resulting in minimum manning or minimal resource situations).  Forward planning of JAG activities should alleviate possible repercussions and assure full-time mission-essential task accomplishment.   
 
JAG Mission Readiness Preparation  
 Although not an exhaustive list, JAGs and paralegals may participate in any or all of the following activities to prepare for support operations: 
  
. Continuing legal education through civilian, joint, and multinational sources. 

. Professional education through Air Force, joint, and multinational sources. 

. Military engagement activities with domestic and foreign agencies and activities. 

. Comparative law studies and interactions with host-nation legal representatives. 

. Joint and multinational exercises and training. 

. Operations planning involvement to direct, control, and sustain Air Force operations. 

. Evaluation of legal principle application to missions, weapons systems, and tactics. 

 
CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS  
 
 JAGs provide decision-makers at all levels with the analysis needed to evaluate options, assess risks, and make law-compliant decisions.  During any deployment, Airmen usually face legal issues comparable to those from previous operations.  While the topics below are not an exhaustive list, they provide a primer on the types of legal issues addressed by JAG corps personnel in the past.  Therefore, JAG personnel remain prepared to address these common legal pitfalls.  See Appendix A. 
 
Legal Basis for Mission  
 The legal basis for a mission aids in defining the parameters, limitations, and scope of the operation.  In order for commanders to determine the best course of action to accomplish the mission within the limits set forth by law, they should know the legal basis of the mission.  For example, a United Nations (UN) Security Council resolution may provide the legal basis for operating under the UN charter, the authority for the use of force, and the status of participating forces.  JAGs assist commanders to focus on the mission, avoid mission creep, and work toward an appropriate end state. 
 
Status of Forces  
 Commanders should be aware of any legal issues that may adversely affect the mission, including the potential applicability of local, host nation, and international law to Air Force personnel and missions.  Determining the status of personnel supporting the military operation is vital.  JAGs should ascertain the status of personnel to ensure they understand the rights and obligations in the host nation.   
 
Planning, Coordination, and Oversight  
 JAG personnel perform a wide variety of planning tasks at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels.  They provide legal advice on the myriad regulations, laws, policies, treaties, and agreements that apply to joint military operations.  JAG personnel actively participate in the entire planning process from analysis, to course of action (COA) development and recommendation, through execution.  
 
 Strategic and operational planning typically occurs at the joint task force (JTF) or at higher echelons.  JAG personnel who perform planning tasks at the tactical level typically do so as members at the wing level or below.  
 
 JAG participation during operations planning at all levels is vital to mission success.  JAGs and paralegals should be integrated into the planning environment and have ready access to needed information and specific personnel who plan and execute the operation.  The legal advice provided by JAGs and paralegals is usually mission-specific.  For example, supporting a commander who is tasked to provide close air support will have different legal issues than a commander who provides airlift and medical evacuation services.  JAG corps personnel provide better legal advice if they understand the organization’s mission, weapons, and weapon systems.medical evacuation services.  JAG corps personnel provide better legal advice if they understand the organization’s mission, weapons, and weapon systems.medical evacuation services.  JAG corps personnel provide better legal advice if they understand the organization’s mission, weapons, and weapon systems.
8 AFDD 3-0 Operations and Planning will expand this concept. It is currently in draft. 
 
Military Justice  
 Air Force forces should maintain good order and discipline to function effectively and accomplish the mission.  JAGs have a duty to ensure advice to commanders is proper so that justice is administered in a fair, consistent, and uniform manner.  For example, there cannot be unjustified differences in punishments based on the status of offenders (e.g., officer versus enlisted, regular Air Force versus ANG and AFR).  Especially when dealing with ANG and AFR forces, it is important to understand the concurrent military justice authority exercised by both the operational and administrative chains of command and the importance of consultation between commanders when contemplating military justice actions. 
 
Claims  
 Prompt adjudication and payment of meritorious claims facilitates the mission by providing the host-nation population an avenue to submit claims for loss or damage because of US military operations.  JAGs and paralegals are responsible for researching foreign claims procedures and making contact with other military claims activities within country as soon as possible.   
 
Rules for the Use of Force  
 The appropriate use of force against lawful targets is a primary concern of the commander.  JAGs and paralegals should understand the legal aspects of the rule for use of force (RUF) for their operation.  JAGs and paralegals should contact their primary ROE/RUF clients—commanders, aircrews, security forces (including augmentees), and SOF personnel to ensure the ROE and RUF facilitate accomplishment of the mission.  Commanders should ensure that all personnel receive training in ROE and RUF.  
 
Base Defense  
 Airmen, particularly security forces personnel, are responsible for detecting and engaging enemy forces that threaten sustained operations.  JAG corps personnel should understand the unique legal issues associated with base defense.  For example, personnel may be tasked to provide personal protection, escort conveys, or employ crew-served weapons and landmines.  JAGs and paralegals should actively engage with Airmen performing base defense duties to ensure they understand the legal issues associated with their actions, ensure the ROE are appropriate for the mission, and investigate and report any potential LOAC violations.  Airmen may also be required to operate outside the perimeter of the supported installation to detect potential threats.  JAGs and paralegals should be prepared to address legal issues associated with the tactics or weapons that may be used by Airmen performing base defense duties.   
 
Noncombatants and Noncombatant Property  
 In many cases, JAG corps personnel will be asked to provide legal advice on noncombatant legal issues, LOAC compliance, and LOAC violations.  Decisions made concerning noncombatant personnel or property may have a legitimate operational purpose that complies with the LOAC, but JAGs should ensure such actions are properly documented in the event a commander is accused of violating the LOAC.  
 
Contractors and Other Civilians Accompanying the Force  
 Military operations are increasingly dependent on support from contractors and civilians accompanying the force.  JAGs and paralegals should address legal issues associated with the employment of these vital support personnel.  
 
Fiscal and Contracting Issues  
 Fiscal law is a potentially contentious issue in the deployed environment.  Many locations witness increased contracting activity as they seek to expand or enhance their infrastructure and capabilities.  Commanders should have a proactive approach, working closely with the JAG, contracting officer, civil engineer, comptroller, and others to ensure that proposed actions remain within the limits of the law.  The same basic contracting and fiscal rules (such as the Anti-Deficiency Act9) apply in the deployed environment as they do at home station.  JAGs, in conjunction with contracting personnel, should assist commanders in ensuring only authorized personnel obligate the government.  Special care should be taken to guard unauthorized personnel from entering into contracts and ensure the proper use of funds during the initial stages of a deployment when everyone is focused on “doing what it takes” to complete the mission.  
9 31 U.S.C., paragraph 1341 
 
Return of Non-Air Force Property and Facilities  
 The absence of a large forward-deployed force and our nation’s involvement in multiple military operations requires the Air Force to maintain an expeditionary force capable of deploying anywhere in the world at anytime.  As a result, the Air Force may need access to property and facilities in support of military operations.  At the outset, JAGs should consider what actions are required to return property and facilities back to the owner.  Failure to address the liability of US use of private or foreign property and facilities use may result in negative consequences upon return of the property or facilities. 
 
OPERATIONS PLANNING  
 
 A COMAFFOR’s JAG corps personnel participate in deliberate and crisis action planning by assisting planners in the application of legal considerations and by recommending legally acceptable courses of action to the commander.  They are responsible for providing legal advice to decision makers on the myriad of laws, policies, treaties, and agreements that influence or impact air, space, and cyberspace operations.   
 
Deliberate Planning  
 Commanders should seek legal advice during each phase of the deliberate planning process to ensure legal considerations are addressed (see Appendix B).  JAGs and paralegals have the following responsibilities during this process: 
 
. Ensure plans comply with relevant multilateral and bilateral international agreements, international law and domestic law, US government policy, and DOD guidance. 

. Prepare the appropriate appendices and annexes to plans. 

. Review the entire plan with a focus on areas with legal significance (e.g., legal authorities, targeting, fiscal considerations, host-nation support agreements, air navigation, use of force, and status of forces). 

. Review relevant supporting plans to ensure appropriate appendices and legal annexes are complete and provide the necessary guidance. 

. Ensure the amount and type of JAGs and paralegals have been identified to deploy in support of operations, or to support operations in-place.   


JAGs and paralegals should be thoroughly familiar with the plans they are tasked to support, the unique legal issues for the supported operational area, and the capabilities of the employment locations they may be tasked to support.  The mission of each employment location will uniquely impact legal readiness requirements.  Therefore, mission success requires advanced planning by all JAGs and paralegals.  See Appendix B, Table B.1. for additional details about the legal support role in deliberate planning. 
Crisis Action Planning   
The responsibilities of JAGs and paralegals during crisis action planning are similar to those during deliberate planning; however, the time available for legal support planning is compressed.  JAGs and paralegals should be familiar with the crisis action planning process and be able to address legal considerations in each phase of the process as outlined in Appendix B, Table B.2. 
 
 
 
 RULES OF ENGAGEMENT   
 
 ROE are rules that govern the use of force to reflect the will of the civilian and military leadership. ROE are defined as “directives issued by competent military authority that delineate the circumstances and limitations under which United States forces will initiate and/or continue combat engagement with other forces encountered”10.  ROE constrain the actions of forces to ensure their actions are consistent with domestic and international law, national policy, and objectives.  ROE are based upon domestic and international law, history, strategy, political concerns, and a vast wealth of operational wisdom, experience, and knowledge provided by military commanders and operators.  Appendix D offers considerations to assist the commander with ROE development. 
The staff judge advocate (SJA) assumes the role of principal assistant to the J-3 [Operations] or J-5 [Plans] in developing and integrating ROE into operational planning. 
 
—CJCSI 3121.01, 
 Standing Rules of Engagement for US Forces, 
Enclosure L 

10 JP 1-04 Legal Support to Military Operations 
 
Purposes  
Commanders at all levels are responsible for establishing ROE/RUF for mission accomplishment that comply with ROE/RUF of senior commanders, the Law of Armed Conflict, applicable international and domestic law and this instruction. 
 
—Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3121.01B, Standing Rules of Engagement/Standing Rules for the Use of Force for US Forces, 
13 June 2005 

 ROE ensure that any use of force is consistent with national security and policy objectives.  Used chiefly to regulate the use of force, ROE either allow or limit the ability and means to employ force.  ROE serve political, military, and legal purposes and define the parameters within which Air Force personnel accomplish their missions.  They ensure national policy and objectives are reflected in the actions of Air Force forces and set constraints on a commander's actions so they are consistent with domestic and international law and national policy.  ROE help ensure the appropriate military capability is applied prudently and often reflect collateral limitations that restrict the use of force far beyond what is required by the LOAC.  History has demonstrated that, to be most effective, ROE should represent a confluence of legal considerations, national policy objectives, and operational concerns.  When the actions of military personnel and units are framed by the disciplined application of force through effective ROE, 
commanders can make sound judgments and select the best possible course of action to accomplish the mission. 
 
 ROE ensure that Air Force forces comply with the LOAC.  Although not law, ROE derive much of their influence from the law.  Air Force forces adhere to the LOAC and embrace the principles set forth therein, including the principles of military necessity, humanity, proportionality, and discrimination.  ROE are an important mechanism to assist commanders in fulfilling their obligations under the LOAC and are often used to reinforce certain principles of the LOAC.   
 
Principles  
Absent specific operational necessity, ROE should never impede the inherent right of self-defense of US forces.  ROE for US forces should not limit a commander's inherent authority and obligation to use all necessary means available to take action in self-defense of the commander's unit and other US forces in the vicinity.  The right and obligation of self-defense should be specified in every set of ROE and should never be compromised; for example, anticipatory self-defense serves as a foundational element in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) standing rules of engagement (SROE), in the concept of hostile intent.  US forces do not have to be the subject of a hostile act before responding in self-defense.  Commanders at every echelon are responsible for establishing or requesting ROE for mission accomplishment that comply with ROE of senior commanders and the SROE. 
By following the ROE principles outlined below, Air Force forces’ missions have a lesser possibility of being compromised and the chances of US political and military objectives being obtained are increased: 
. ROE should complement US interests and military objectives.  Commanders should impose restrictions on the use of force when justified to accomplish the mission.  Restricting the use of force should be designed in accordance with the commander’s intent and mission planning guidance.  A proper balance is essential to ensure Air Force forces appropriately respond to enemy forces, as political and diplomatic reasons may exist for controlling the use of force.  Commanders should have the latitude and flexibility necessary to employ force to meet military objectives within a broad array of permissible boundaries. 

. ROE should not be too specific or restrictive.  ROE should restrict the use of force to prevent overreaction or unnecessary escalation of the conflict, but should be permissive enough to ensure friendly forces are not too limited.  For example, ROE that are written too broadly may result in an unintentional escalation of conflict or the possibility of fratricide.  By contrast, ROE that are too narrow may unnecessarily restrict the effects of Air Force operations. 

. ROE should be current and responsive to change.  Changing mission requirements equates to a constant review of ROE.  ROE should account for changes in political or military objectives, the commander’s intent, and the threat to 

US forces.  For example, ROE that govern information operations should be responsive to changes in the mission, environment, technology, and the evolving threat.  Commanders should establish or request changes to the ROE to ensure the use of force is consistent with mission accomplishment and the commander’s intent. 

. ROE should not diminish operational effectiveness.  ROE should permit effective control over forces by the COMAFFOR.  ROE should not be specific instructions for how to employ forces, as no set rules—no matter how lengthy or detailed—can address every possible scenario that combat forces may face while conducting operations.  ROE should permit flexibility and enable the commander to maximize the contributions of airpower across the spectrum of conflict and support to operations. 

. ROE should permit the timely and appropriate use of force.  ROE should ensure force is applied in a well-disciplined manner, but should not delay the prompt execution of time-sensitive operations or attacks on targets of opportunity.  Commanders should seek clarification or guidance through the chain of command, or submit a request to modify the ROE, if the ROE are not clear or could jeopardize the prompt engagement of time-sensitive targets. 


Characteristics   
 Effective ROE allow commanders to apply the principles of war and the tenets of airpower to support national security objectives without constraining capabilities of forces.  To maximize operational effectiveness, ROE should: 
 
. Be transparent and clearly linked to mission accomplishment. 

. Be continually briefed to all Airmen by commanders, warfighters, and JAGs. 

. Be tailored to the audience and easy to understand, remember, and apply. 

. Be constantly reviewed for modification or amplification. 

. Be simple, clear, brief, and seamless. 

. Avoid excessively qualified language. 

. Avoid mention of strategy or doctrine. 

. Avoid restating the LOAC. 


JAG Staff Role in ROE Development  
  
 JAGs and paralegals do not own or control the ROE process, but serve as the principal advisor to the COMAFFOR and staff.  The JAGs and paralegals have an affirmative duty to provide legal advice to commanders and their staffs that is consistent with the law and the governing ROE at all times.  Ordinarily, JAGs provide legal advice to commanders who will select the most appropriate course of action to accomplish the mission.  For example, during joint operations, a JAG assists in the development of ROE, but the operators (planning and executing in the operational chain of command) have the responsibility to formulate and submit ROE for approval to the COMAFFOR.  In turn, the COMAFFOR presents proposed changes to the JFC.  
 
Developing ROE  
 
JAGs and paralegals provide advice during all levels of operations planning to support and sustain ROE development.  They advise commanders and their staffs throughout all phases of the joint operations planning process to help ensure ROE are legally acceptable, operationally feasible, and properly balanced against applicable law, national policy, and commander's intent and guidance.  JAGs and paralegals should be involved early in the planning process to ensure effective ROE are developed.  Early involvement ensures legal issues are identified and legally acceptable courses of action and supporting ROE are developed consistent with the commander’s intent.  A thorough understanding of operational issues aids JAGs in preparing advice that allows commanders to achieve their objectives within the limits of the law and national policy.  For example, to properly advise an operational commander, a JAG should be fully cognizant of the commander’s “no strike” and “restricted” target lists.  Involved and engaged JAGs maximize planning efforts and help ensure proper ROE are developed to support mission accomplishment. 
 
 ROE should be developed to support the mission requirements of an operation and should be crafted to minimize delays in the execution of time-sensitive operations.  For example, during all phases of an operation, from planning to execution, JAGs and paralegals tailor legal advice to support the targeting cycle.  JAGs assist in the development of ROE that allow Air Force forces to attack time-sensitive targets effectively. 
 
 ROE development and mission planning are collaborative processes and require significant staff integration.  ROE development is best achieved when legal support and operators collaborate to develop ROE or request supplemental measures to fully implement the commander’s intent.  JAGs advise operations and planning staffs on the legality of proposed ROE and, when necessary, recommend actions to ensure compliance with the law and policy.  
 
Interpreting ROE  
  
 An Air Force JAG’s ROE role is that of an interpreter and advisor, not a decision maker.  JAGs and paralegals interpret ROE to support the execution of time-sensitive operations.  Legal staff should understand the intent of the President, SecDef, CCDR, and subordinate commanders when preparing advice on ROE.  A JAG’s primary duty is accurate counsel to command on the law and the commander's responsibilities with respect to the law.  In this advisory capacity, JAGs focus on interpreting the ROE, the 
LOAC, and other guidance to develop legal recommendations that will advance the commander’s objectives.  Thus, JAGs should be thoroughly familiar with international and domestic law, national policy, operations orders, and other information to interpret intent and meaning of ROE, effectively.  After considering legal advice, commanders ultimately exercise their discretion, wisdom, and decision-making authority to select the best course of action that will comply with the law and further mission accomplishment. 
  
 JAGs and paralegals interpret ROE issued from multiple sources.  Each operation has a unique set of ROE to support the needs of a particular mission.  Generally, combatant commanders and higher authority establish ROE.  ROE usually incorporates political, military, and legal concerns.  For all US operations, the CJCS SROE is the starting point for ROE unless rules have been previously established in contingency plans or through agreements with other nations.  Drafting ROE to support multinational forces under the operational control of a US or a foreign commander requires detailed coordination and a thorough understanding of the laws, policies, and political objectives of each contributing nation.  JAGs and paralegals develop comparative law studies that identify the legal requirements of each nation to ensure multinational ROE will not conflict with the obligations of each contributing nation.  JAGs support commanders by analytically interpreting legal requirements and obligations of other nations.  They also deduce ROE from multiple sources. 
 
Modifying ROE  
  
 JAGs and paralegals assist commanders in modifying or requesting changes to the ROE.  With few exceptions, ROE are fundamentally permissive in nature and allow commanders to modify or request changes to the ROE to support mission accomplishment.  At various levels in the operational chain of command, ROE supplemental measures may be approved to allow or limit the use of force for mission accomplishment.  JAGs and paralegals assist commanders in determining appropriate ROE and recommend changes when necessary.  Commanders should seek modification to ROE through the chain of command.  Modification and clarification may be warranted when the ROE are inadequate, faulty, create the risk of fratricide, or hinder a commander's ability to carry out the mission. 
 
Implementing ROE  
  
 Air Force commanders expect JAGs to know and fully advise Air Force forces on ROE.  JAGs and paralegals at every stage of an operation maintain situational awareness of current ROE and should be prepared to recommend changes to the commander.   
 
 JAGs and paralegals assist commanders in fulfilling their obligations to implement and disseminate ROE.  In addition, they work in concert with commanders and their staffs to train forces on the ROE and to standardize and interpret their intent and meaning.  JAGs provide tailored ROE training to various audiences, from aircrews to security forces.  For example, JAGs may provide training on ROE, status of personnel, mission and forces, Code of Conduct for US Forces, and other constraints imposed by the law. 
 
RULES FOR THE USE OF FORCE  
  
 JAGs advise commanders on the RUF that apply when DOD forces are performing civil support missions and routine Service functions including force protection within the US and its territories or when DOD forces are performing law enforcement or security duties within (when permitted by Posse Comitatus) or outside the US.  JAG corps personnel advise commanders on the process for seeking RUF modification, as required.  JAG corps personnel also train Service members on the RUF or RUF policies for law enforcement and security operations. 
 
  
CONCLUSION  
  
 This doctrine document described the power of command, including fundamental legal aspects, legal roles and responsibilities of the COMAFFOR, and common legal issues.  Commanders at all levels and across the range of military operations (ROMO) should be familiar with JAG roles and capabilities.  Legal and operational readiness of the force is critical.  JAGs support Air Force operations at all levels by providing Air Force commanders the legal analysis and advice needed to make informed and legally sound decisions.  Whether JAG corps personnel are tasked to support humanitarian operations or combat operations during a major theater war, JAG corps personnel remain prepared. 
 
 Because Air Force missions are demanding, precise, and many times are performed in Air Force expeditionary operations and complex international environments , the very best in legal capability is essential for mission success.  The Air Force JAG Corps supplies a talented and highly trained group of military legal professionals—attorneys and paralegals, civilian, Active Duty regular Air Force, Air National Guard, and Reserve members.  These members ensure the JAG Corps is capable of providing mission essential full-time legal support to our Air Force, both today and in the future.

APPENDIX C 
 
LEGAL READINESS CONSIDERATIONS 
 
Readying the Force  
 While not an exhaustive list, JAGs and paralegals may take any or all of the following actions to ready the force: 
 
. Advise commanders of forces preparing for deployment. 

. Develop and implement robust preventive law programs. 

. Participate in the logistics support process to obtain, pre-position, or transfer resources to sustain operations. 

. Provide training and mission-related legal assistance on the legal issues influencing readiness (e.g., estate planning, LOAC, ROE). 

. Prepare legal support capabilities for deployment. 


Preparing the Operational Environment  
 Following are examples of the actions JAGs and paralegals may take to prepare the force: 
 
. Identify and resolve legal issues within the operational environment (e.g., host-nation support, use of force, environmental constraints). 

. Remove, document, or resolve legal impediments encountered during base support planning activities. 

. Determine legal reachback capabilities and requirements available to support forward deployed forces and those required to sustain operations. 

. Identify legal support requirements and capabilities needed to support operations (e.g., legal services, equipment, facilities). 


Positioning the Force  
 JAGs and paralegals may take any or all of the following actions to position the force: 
 
. Deploy as part of advance and reception teams or operational cadre to receive and beddown deploying forces. 

. Participate in negotiations for host-nation support and the status of US forces in a host-nation (e.g., foreign criminal jurisdiction, landing fees, use of facilities, claims provisions, taxes). 

. Develop comparative law studies of the operational environment (e.g., civil and criminal procedures, summary of unique host-nation laws, rights of US personnel apprehended by host-nation authorities). 

. Support logistics processes to obtain goods and services from the local economy (e.g., contingency contracting actions, environmental law, and land use issues). 

. Assist commanders and their staffs in developing local policies and procedures to protect the force and maintain discipline (e.g., General Order #1; Force Protection Plan). 

. Educate deploying forces on legal issues and policies that apply to the location and operations conducted from the location (e.g., host-nation law, ROE, claims provisions). 

. Liaison with applicable US agencies and nongovernmental organizations within the host-nation. 


Employing the Force 
 Following are some examples of actions JAGs and paralegals may take to employ the force: 
 
. Refine the legal support requirements for the location and establish reachback connectivity. 

. Accomplish mission training for the supported population (e.g., ROE, LOAC, General Order #1). 

. Support actions to generate operational elements of the force (e.g., logistics support, operations planning, target reviews). 

. Develop and organize legal services to support continuing operations (e.g., legal assistance, claims services, military justice support, and legal support to C2). 


Sustaining the Force  
 While not an exhaustive list, JAGs and paralegals may take any or all of the following actions to sustain the force: 
 
. Provide full-spectrum legal services to Air Force forces at forward operating locations (e.g., courts-martial, legal assistance, claims, C2 support). 

. Employ legal reachback capabilities to enhance legal services (e.g., connectivity to legal information services, liaison with legal specialists). 

. Refine legal support requirements and adjust legal services to meet mission requirements (e.g., ROE changes, tax program, and upgraded equipment). 

. Provide continuous support for the logistics processes (e.g., military construction, long-term service contracts, and new contracts). 

. Support C2 activities and ongoing operations (e.g., ROE training, target reviews, ATO generation). 


Recovering the Force  
 Examples of actions JAGs and paralegals may take to recover the force: 
 
. Address legal issues concerning real property, materials, and real estate that are returned to the owner or host-nation (e.g., environmental impact, value of improvements to facilities). 

. Provide mission-related personal legal services to recovering Air Force forces. 

. Ensure defense goods and services are sold, transferred, disposed of, or returned in accordance with law and policy (e.g., fitness equipment, temporary facilities, tent platforms, supplies). 

. Adjudicate and settle claims for and against US forces (e.g., personal injury, property damage). 

. Provide legal support to forces remaining behind to support recovery operations (e.g., legal assistance, contracting support, and logistics). 

. Consider whether the limited time ARC forces are called to duty drive any special redeployment prioritization or processing. 


APPENDIX D 
 
ROE CONSIDERATIONS 
 
Primary ROE Considerations 
What do the ROE say? 
 
. When can US forces and others be defended? 

. What can be attacked? 

. How can it be attacked? 

. Where can it be attacked? 

. When can it be attacked? 

. Whose permission is needed to attack? 


What purpose do the ROE serve? 
 
. Provide guidance on the use of force—political, military, and legal. 

. Control the transition from peace to war (or vice versa). 

. Provide a mechanism to facilitate planning. 

. Prevent fratricide, civilian casualties, national/coalition political damage, or mission failure. 


Have ROE been agreed upon for multinational operations? 
 
. By military commanders? 

. By policy makers? 

. Do the ROE of the multinational force permit the same degree of individual self-defense and unit self-defense as the US SROE? 


ROE Fundamentals 
Mission Planning 
 
. ROE are not a substitute for guidance, intent, and judgment or planning. 

. ROE development is a collaborative process involving commanders, operators, JAGs, and others. 

. ROE development is an integral part of operations planning including branch/sequel plans. 

. ROE development begins with mission analysis. 

. ROE instructions are set out in the commander’s initial planning guidance. 

. ROE development is tied to COA development. 

. COA analysis includes ROE refinement. 


Advisories 
 
. US ROE are fundamentally permissive. 

. Brief current ROE at every JTF update. 

. Monitor ROE training and interpretation. 

. Do not substitute ROE for planning. 

. Use serial ROE messages and not appendices. 

. Do not just ask for ROE—justify ROE. 

. Resolve ROE disputes before the fight. 

. Understand that ROE during irregular warfare are normally more restrictive than in traditional war. 


ROE Game Plan 
Establish a close working relationship with your JAG. 
 
. Early judge advocate involvement in each of the AOC divisions helps satisfy the legal review obligations under the LOAC and avoids potential last-minute problems with ATO approval and mission execution. 

. JAGs can identify and defuse potential showstoppers with host nations and overflight early in the planning process. 

. JAGs can assist operators in getting clear, concise ROE and special instructions crafted and approved. 


Establish an ROE cell to enhance mission planning and execution.  A critical function is JAG involvement at inception to maximize planning efforts and to yield lawful ROE. 
 
. Formulate ROE requests based on JFC objectives, guidance, and intent. 

. Ensure adequate dissemination of: 

. .  Chairman of the CJCS SROE. 

. .  Any theater-specific ROE.   

. .  Mission-specific ROE (often termed "serial ROE"). 

. .  Applicable multinational or coalition ROE. 

. Determine if ROE amendments/supplements are needed. 

. Institute scenario-based ROE training (JAGs can coordinate efforts). 


Determine the effect of the ROE.  ROE and international law, to include LOAC, often impact targeting decisions.  A good rule of thumb is to factor these restraints into the planning/targeting process early on. 
 
Establish combat identification procedures that are consistent with the ROE. 
 
. Allow units and individuals to conduct actions appropriate for self-defense. 

. Adjust ROE to fit warfighter needs. 


APPENDIX E 
 
OVERVIEW OF US CODE SECTIONS IMPACTING DOD 
 
United States Codes (U.S.C.) – Federal law is codified and compiled in the US Code, which is comprised of 50 different titles that generally deal with different areas of the law.  An overview of the different U.S. Code titles that impact DOD operations follows:  
 
Title 10 – Armed Forces 
. Title 10 has five subtitles:  General Military Law; Army; Navy and Marine Corps; Air Force; and Reserve Components. 



 
. Title 10 generally includes federal law that impacts the Department of Defense, the various individual military departments, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and all manner of military issues. 



 
. When discussing regular and reserve component forces, regular component forces are sometimes referred to as “Title 10” forces. 



 
Title 18 – Crimes and Criminal Procedure 
. Title 18 addresses federal crimes and criminal procedure. 


 
. Crimes alleged to have been committed by US military personnel are primarily addressed through the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which is addressed in Title 10. 


 
Title 32 – National Guard  
. Title 32 has five subchapters addressing:  Organization; Personnel; Training; Service, Supply and Procurement; and Homeland Defense Activities. 



 
. Title 32 generally addresses the federal operations of the National Guard. 



 
. When acting in a state capacity under Title 32, or on State active duty status, then state law is also applicable. 



 
. When discussing active and reserve component forces, National Guard forces are sometimes referred to as “Title 32” forces when they are acting in their state capacity. 



 
Title 50 – War and National Defense 
. Title 50 generally addresses intelligence and surveillance activities by US government agencies and other issues relating to war, insurrection and national defense.

This Instruction implements AFPD 38-1, Organization and Unit Designations.  It describes the objectives and principles of Air Force organization.  It prescribes various levels and standard structures for organizations and it outlines procedures for establishing and modifying organizations. 
This publication applies to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and the Air National Guard (ANG) to the extent that it has the organizations and functions discussed herein.  In collaboration with the Chief of Air Force Reserve (AF/RE) and the Director of the Air National Guard (NGB/CF), the Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower, Personnel and Services (AF/A1) develops policy for the Air Force Organization.  This AFI may be supplemented at any level; all MAJCOM level supplements must be approved by the Human Resource Management Strategic Board (HSB) prior to certification and approval.  Supplements (other than ANG and AFRC) are routed to Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ USAF) Manpower, Organization and Resources, Organization Division (AF/A1MO) for coordination prior to further staffing.  AFI content changes related to ANG and AFRC should be approved by NGB/CF through the ANG Manpower, Organization and Resources Division (NGB/A1M); or AF/RE through the AFRC Manpower, Organization and Resources Division (AFRC/A1M), respectively.  Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to AF/A1MO using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the Major Command (MAJCOM) manpower, organization and resources division.  Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records 
Disposition Schedule (RDS).  The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the compliance statement.  See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, for a description of the authorities associated with the Tier numbers.  Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval authority, or alternately, to the publication OPR for non-tiered compliance items.  The use of a name or mark of any specific manufacturer, commercial product, commodity, or service in this publication does not imply endorsement by the Air Force. 
SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
This revision makes a number organizational updates, clarifications and administrative and formatting changes.  Specific administrative and formatting changes include:  adding tiering requirements; updating publication references, examples and offices symbols; numbers the narrative parts of the standard structures for ease of reference and to facilitate future updates; and adding descriptions for the standard squadrons depicted in this AFI.  The revision updates organization size guidance to incorporate specialized organization size guidance for Air Reserve Component, medical and comptroller units.  It also adds a note to the organization size guidance regarding upcoming changes to the source for contractor information, clarifies guidance on student population included in organization sizing, adds guidance on Foreign National Indirect Hire civilians, and renumbers sections as needed.  The revision incorporates approved changes to functional organization structures:  makes Wing Staff changes to update responsibilities for Inspector General and Plans functions; updates Information Protection and Equal Opportunity descriptions; realigns the Antiterrorism Officer from wing level to the Security Forces Squadron; adds Installation Resilience Program reference; updates the Comptroller Squadron to reflect realignment of resource advisors; adds options regarding alignment of Intelligence in the Operations Group and Operations Support Squadron; adds detail and standardized Office Symbol Codes to the Operations Squadron; updates the operations squadron structure for Missile Squadrons; realigns Ground Radar and Airfield Systems responsibilities from the Communications Squadron to the Operations Support Squadron; eliminates the Maintenance Operations Squadrons, adds Maintenance Squadron for Missile Organizations and updates the Maintenance Group to reflect realignment of maintenance operations functions to it; revises Missile Maintenance Squadron flight descriptions; changes the Office Symbol Codes in the Contracting Squadron; updates the Civil Engineer (CE) Squadron due to CE transformation; changes Honor Guard alignment within the Force Support Squadron; and revises the Logistics Readiness Squadron due to functional updates.  The revision makes a number of minor updates to the medical unit structures including:  addressing functional advisors; reflecting realignment of the Drug Demand Reduction Program from the Mental Health Flight in the Medical Operations Squadron to under the wing commander; updating Aerospace and Operational Physiology Flight name in Medical Operations Squadron and Aerospace Medicine Squadron; eliminating Trainee Health flights from the Aerospace Medicine Squadron and Health and Wellness Centers from the Health Promotion Flight in the Aerospace Medicine Squadron; and updating the Inpatient Operations Squadron and Surgical Operations Squadron Perioperative Flight and Surgical Services Flight descriptions, respectively, to change central sterile supply to sterile processing department.  The revision updates Office Symbol Code (OSC) guidance, including updating the character limit for office OSC titles in data systems and adding guidance 
relevant to OSCs as used in MPES that was recently deleted from AFMAN 33-326, Preparing Official Communications.  It adds or modifies information for certain types of organizations based on recent reorganizations (Component MAJCOM, Complex, Center, Named Component Headquarters, Air Operations Centers, and Commanders Support Staff).  It clarifies named activity information and adds a triennial review.  It adds a note to HQ USAF definition advising that additional information on HQ USAF can be found in AFMD 1, Headquarters Air Force.  It modifies Figure 2.1, Organizational Schemes, to reflect addition of complexes and make formatting changes for clarity.  It clarifies:  language concerning commandants and fixes paragraph numbering; that standard structures apply to units designated as flights vs. squadrons due to organization size guidance and to similarly named units that include Special Operations in their designations; that guidance concerning attachment of wing staff personnel to Comptroller Squadrons also applies to Regular Air Force (RegAF) Comptroller Flights; authority for detachment and operating location actions; language on linking A-staff OSCs in MAJCOM headquarters; wording on certain Organization Change Request (OCR) questions (3, 6 and 8); guidance for reassignment of units between commands; guidance on when an OCR is not required for a unit action due to inclusion in a Program Action Directive, force structure inactivation, etc.; and some aspects of action effective dates as they relate to DAF/A1M letters.  In addition, it clarifies and updates some areas of the provisional unit guidance.  It adds a reminder about various types of notification requirements.  It adds reference to appropriate AFIs for management headquarters activity guidance.  It updates size guidance associated with establishment of squadron sections.  It revises language on Air Force Elements to clarify that it does not apply to other types of elements.  Status Change is added to the Organizational Terminology.  It updates detachment & operating location information.  It deletes references to A7.

Attachment 1— GLOSSARY OF REFERENCES AND SUPPORTING INFORMATION  113 
 
Chapter 1 
AIR FORCE ORGANIZATION OBJECTIVES, PRINCIPLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
1.1.  Organization Objectives.  Air Force organizations are designed to achieve the characteristics outlined in AFPD 38-1. 
1.2.  Organization Principles.  Air Force organizational structure follows these management principles: 
1.2.1.  Emphasis on Wartime Tasks. Organizations are structured to accomplish wartime tasks without reorganizing. 
1.2.2.  Functional Grouping. Organizations have these characteristics: a clear-cut purpose, goal and scope, with one individual in charge; parts that form a logical, separable activity; a close relationship among the parts, constituting a complete entity; and natural divisions of work that clearly define where responsibility begins and ends. 
1.2.3.  Lean Organizational Structures. Organizations should encourage rapid decision making, so they should be flat structures without intermediate levels, unless mission requirements cannot otherwise be met. When used, intermediate organizations should consist of tactical functions only, without a full range of staff functions. Organizational levels that exist only to review and transmit information or tasking should be eliminated. Both the number of supervisors and the number of internal subdivisions within organizations should be designed to minimize layers and maximize worker-to-supervisor ratios. 
1.2.4.  Skip-Echelon Structure. Major commands (MAJCOM) sit on top of a skip-echelon staffing structure. MAJCOMs, wings and squadrons possess the full range of staff functions needed to perform required tasks.  Numbered/named air forces (NAF), groups and flights have no or minimal staff. These tactical echelons are designed to increase operational effectiveness rather than to review and transmit paperwork. The chain of command and responsibility for mission accomplishment runs through commanders at all levels. Problems, however, often are solved by staff communication through the functional chain, bypassing echelons where the function is not found.  (Note:  Component NAFs (C-NAFs) possess a broader staff to support the Air Force component commander; see Paragraph 2.2.5.2 and Figure 3.2.) 
1.2.5.  Standard Levels. The Air Force uses the standard levels described in Chapter 2 to design organizations. Establish organizations at the lowest level required to successfully accomplish the primary mission. Factors such as scope of responsibility, span of control and functional grouping of related missions/activities are the predominant factors that determine organizational type. 
1.3.  Responsibilities Assigned: 
1.3.1.  Headquarters US Air Force (HQ USAF) and the MAJCOMs, field operating agencies (FOA), and direct reporting units (DRU) work toward meeting Air Force organizational goals. The Director of Manpower, Organization and Resources (AF/A1M) is responsible for 
leading and monitoring progress. HQ USAF functional chiefs give assistance in their functional areas. 
1.3.2.  AF/A1M is responsible for the administrative control of all units in the Air Force. It publishes Department of the Air Force (DAF/A1M) letters, which are the legal authority for a unit and authorize such actions as unit activations, redesignations and inactivations. 
1.3.3.  MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs must follow the organizational procedures and standard structures described herein. (T-1) A MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU must have AF/A1M approval to deviate from a standard structure and to activate, redesignate, or inactivate units (see Chapter 6 for procedures). (T-1).  MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs approve non-standard organizational structures while adhering to applicable guidance.  HQ USAF offices, designated FOAs and other supported organizations work with the HQ USAF Resources Directorate (SAF/AAR) for approval of non-standard organizational structures. 
1.3.4.  Individual unit commanders must use the standard organizational structures found in this Instruction.  (T-1). If a unit's unique mission or location requires a different structure, a waiver to the standard structure can be requested using the organizational change procedures found in Chapter 6.  Units work with their servicing Manpower and Organization activity on such requests (for most field units, this activity is in the Manpower and Personnel Flight of the base Force Support Squadron). 
Chapter 2 
STANDARD LEVELS OF AIR FORCE ORGANIZATION & ASSOCIATED TERMS 
(Note:  See Chapter 4 for related terminology and procedures.) 
2.1.  Organizational Entities.  The Air Force is comprised of establishments, units, and nonunits. 
2.1.1.  Establishment. An organizational entity consisting of a headquarters unit and its subordinate units. The name of the establishment is in the name of the headquarters unit. For example, Air Mobility Command (AMC) is an establishment; HQ AMC is its headquarters. Subordinate units are assigned to the establishment and not to the headquarters unit. 
2.1.1.1.  A group with subordinate squadrons is generally the lowest-level establishment. Lower-level establishments are assigned to higher-level ones; for example: groups to wings, wings to NAFs, NAFs to MAJCOMs, MAJCOMs to HQ USAF. This arrangement (units reporting to establishments, subordinate establishments to superior ones) sets up the chain of command, through which all control and accountability flow. 
2.1.1.2.  Establishments facilitate organizational actions. For example, the reassignment of a wing (establishment) from one NAF to another automatically reassigns the wing's subordinate units. 
2.1.2.  Unit. A military organization constituted by HQ USAF or, for provisional units only, designated by a MAJCOM, FOA or DRU. A unit is either named or numbered. 
2.1.2.1.  A unit helps provide for an unbroken chain of command since military personnel are assigned to a unit at all times. Normally, a unit having military members has an officer designated as its commander. A civilian may lead a unit in approved circumstances, and provide supervision to military and civilian personnel in the unit. Appointment of a civilian to lead a unit designates that unit as civilian-led. When a civilian is appointed to lead a unit, that individual is the director of that unit. (In the case of a civilian-led unit, the chain of command is maintained by having it reside with the first military unit commander above the civilian-led unit.) 
2.1.2.1.1.  Civilians cannot assume military command or exercise command over military members within the unit. Units designated to be led by directors will not have commanders and alternative arrangements for functions, which are performed by commanders, are required (see AFI 51-604, Appointment to and Assumption of Command). (T-0). A civilian director of a unit is authorized to perform all functions normally performed by a unit commander of like position and authority except as required by law (e.g., Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)) or controlling superior authority (e.g., Department of Defense (DoD) guidance, instruction by a superior commander).  For guidance concerning whether an authority or action is explicitly reserved for military commanders, contact the servicing staff judge advocate. 
2.1.2.2.  The following terms apply to a unit: 
2.1.2.2.1.  Active Unit. A MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU constituted and activated by HQ USAF; or a subordinate unit constituted by HQ USAF, assigned to a MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU and activated by special order. 
2.1.2.2.2.  Inactive Unit. A unit constituted by HQ USAF but not yet activated or a unit constituted, activated and subsequently, inactivated. 
2.1.2.2.3.  Disbanded Unit. A unit whose legal authority for existence is withdrawn by HQ USAF. Its designation is retired and preserved in historical records. 
2.1.2.2.4.  Parent Unit. An organization that directly administers units, detachments, or operating locations assigned to it. 
2.1.2.2.5.  Provisional Unit. A temporary unit organized to perform a specific task.  (See Chapter 8 for guidance on provisional units.) 
2.1.2.2.6.  Attached Unit. A unit, or part of a unit, placed under the control of another organization for a specific purpose such as operational control, administrative control, or logistic support. It is still assigned to the parent unit. 
2.1.2.2.7.  Detached Unit. A unit serving away from its organization of assignment. It may function independently, or may be attached to another organization. 
2.1.2.2.8.  Primary Subordinate Unit (PSU). A unit that performs part or all of the primary mission of the organization to which it is assigned. The unit reports to the commander of the parent organization and has full authority to execute its assigned mission.  A PSU’s purpose is to perform part of its parent organization’s main mission and not to provide support functions for its parent headquarters.  Under a MAJCOM, examples include NAFs, Air University (AETC) and the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFMC).  Similarly, under a wing, squadrons are PSUs of their group and the groups are PSUs of the wing. 
2.1.3.  Nonunit. An organizational entity that is not constituted by HQ USAF as a unit. 
2.1.3.1.  The following terms apply to a nonunit: 
2.1.3.1.1.  Named Activity. A part of a unit whose mission can be identified better by assigning it a definitive name (for example, the Civil Engineer School is part of a unit, the Air Force Institute of Technology). HQ USAF is responsible for administering the designation, redesignation and inactivation of named activities and authorizes them by issuing DAF/A1M letters.  Every three years, AF/A1MO will conduct a review with the MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs and SAF/AAR to validate the continuing requirement and proper alignment of named activities.  Note:  Activity should not be used in unit designations to avoid confusion with named activities (which are nonunits). 
2.1.3.1.2.  Detachment. Part of a unit that is separated geographically from its parent unit. Although not a unit for organizational purposes, if a commissioned officer is assigned and appointed on orders as a commander, the commander has nonjudicial punishment authority under the UCMJ unless withheld by superior competent authority (see AFI 51-202, Nonjudicial Punishment). 
2.1.3.1.3.  Operating Location. Part of a unit that is separated geographically from its parent unit. It is used to account for personnel by location. Personnel remain assigned to the parent unit. An operating location has none of the administrative attributes of a unit and does not have nonjudicial punishment authority under the UCMJ. 
2.1.3.1.4.  Squadron Section. A function responsible for the administrative control of all members assigned to a unit. A squadron section is created by appointing a section commander on special orders in accordance with guidance in AFI 51-604. A squadron section commander has nonjudicial punishment authority under the UCMJ unless withheld by superior competent authority (see AFI 51-202).  Section commanders at other organizational levels may use a term reflecting their unit level, e.g., Group Section Commander, etc. 
2.1.3.1.5.  Commanders Support Staff.  A function responsible for providing direct support for a unit or section commander, primarily in administering unit personnel and administrative programs.  In squadrons, the function uses the office symbol code (OSC) “CCQ” and OSC title “Orderly Room.”  Above the squadron level, the OSC is “CSS” and the office title is “Commanders Support Staff.”  When there is a squadron section, this function falls under it. 
2.1.3.1.6.  Air Force Element. A non-unit nomenclature used to account for manpower authorizations and to identify Air Force personnel on duty with organizations outside the Air Force, such as defense agencies, defense field activities and Air National Guard units not in federal service. Although not a unit for organizational purposes, an Air Force Element may function as a unit if so designated by competent authority, an eligible commissioned officer either assumes command or is appointed to command and Air Force members are assigned or attached to the Air Force Element (see Paragraph 4.3.3.5). 
2.2.  Standard Levels of Air Force Organization.  The following standard levels of organization are used in structuring and designating Air Force units: 
(Note:  Consult AFI 38-204, Programming USAF Manpower, and AFI 38-202, Air Force Management Headquarters and Headquarters Support Activities, for direction on how Major DoD Headquarters Activities guidance affects certain types of USAF organizations, in particular, HQ USAF, MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs and NAFs.) 
2.2.1.  Headquarters US Air Force (HQ USAF). The senior headquarters of the Air Force, consisting of two major entities: the Secretariat (including the Secretary of the Air Force and the Secretary's principal staff) and the Air Staff, headed by the Chief of Staff.  Note:  Detailed information on HQ USAF’s mission, command structure and responsibilities can be found in Air Force Mission Directive (AFMD) 1, Headquarters Air Force. 
2.2.2.  Major Command (MAJCOM). A major subdivision of the Air Force that is assigned a major part of the Air Force mission.  A MAJCOM is directly subordinate to HQ USAF.  Most MAJCOMs have the word Command as part of their designation; Command should not be used in the designation of any unit that is not a MAJCOM.  MAJCOM headquarters have the full range of functional staff (excluding functions that have been centralized elsewhere for Air Force-wide execution).  MAJCOMs, in turn, may be subdivided according to either of the organizational schemes shown in Figure 2.1.  The levels in each scheme are in 
descending order and represent levels of assignment.  A unit cannot be assigned to an organization of equivalent or lower level.  For example, a group can be assigned to any organization listed above it, but a group cannot be assigned to another group or to a squadron.

2.2.2.1.  Lead MAJCOM.  A type of MAJCOM that consolidates responsibilities for a particular function in a single MAJCOM, supporting the entire Air Force as applicable.  For example, Air Education and Training Command is the Lead MAJCOM for education and training. 
2.2.2.2.  Component MAJCOM (C-MAJCOM).  A type of MAJCOM that is the USAF component to a Unified Combatant Command.  For example, Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) is a C-MAJCOM that is the USAF component to United States Pacific Command (USPACOM).  A C-MAJCOM is commanded by the Commander of Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) and includes supporting staff and all assigned and attached forces.  A C-MAJCOM may have one or more C-NAFs through which it presents its forces to the Combatant Commander (CCDR).  The C-MAJCOM integrates, at the strategic level, component activities across all phases of conflict.  The C-MAJCOM staff should not duplicate the functions of the C-NAF AFFOR staff or Air Operations Center (AOC) (see Figure 3.2).  The C-MAJCOM commander is the CCDR’s theater COMAFFOR and may function as a theater Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) when required.  Refer to Air Force Doctrine Volume 3, Command, for additional information on component relationships and roles.  Note:  A MAJCOM can be both a C-MAJCOM and a Lead MAJCOM. 
2.2.3.  Direct Reporting Unit (DRU). A subdivision of the Air Force, directly subordinate to the Chief of Staff, US Air Force. A DRU performs a mission that does not fit into any of the MAJCOMs. A DRU has many of the same administrative and organizational responsibilities as a MAJCOM. 
2.2.3.1.  Major Command Direct Reporting Unit (MAJCOM DRU). DRU also applies to a subdivision of a MAJCOM. A MAJCOM DRU reports directly to the MAJCOM commander and performs a mission that does not fit into any of the MAJCOM's primary subordinate units.  (Note:  See Paragraph 6.2.4. for additional guidance on establishment of DRUs or MAJCOM DRUs.) 
2.2.4.  Field Operating Agency (FOA). A subdivision of the Air Force, directly subordinate to a HQ USAF functional manager.  A FOA performs field activities beyond the scope of any of the major commands.  The activities are specialized or associated with an Air Force-wide mission and should minimize staff functions.  Air Force FOAs usually have the word Agency as part of their designation; Agency should not be used in the designation of any unit that is not a FOA directly under HQ USAF.  Note:  Organization guidance for MAJCOMs also applies to the large Air Force FOAs that are structured along MAJCOM lines. 
2.2.4.1.  Major Command Field Operating Agency (MAJCOM FOA). FOA also applies to a subdivision of a MAJCOM. A MAJCOM FOA reports directly to a MAJCOM functional principal (e.g., 2-letter office such as director) and performs specialized field activities beyond the scope of any of the MAJCOM's primary subordinate units. The activities are specialized and are associated with MAJCOM or theater-wide missions that transcend the scope of routine wing functions. FOAs should minimize staff functions.  (Note:  See Paragraph 6.2.4. for additional guidance on establishment of FOAs or MAJCOM FOAs.) 
2.2.5.  Numbered/Named Air Force (NAF). A level of command directly under a MAJCOM.  NAFs provide operational leadership and supervision.  A NAF is assigned subordinate units, such as wings, groups and squadrons.  They do not have complete functional staffs. 
2.2.5.1.  NAFs designated as component NAFs (C-NAF) support the Air Force component commander (COMAFFOR) at the operational and tactical level.  When designated as the Air Force component to a Unified Combatant Command (UCC), the component NAF will function at the strategic, operational and tactical level.  A C-NAF is authorized a broader staff as depicted in Figure 3.2. 
2.2.5.2.  The number of persons assigned to a NAF headquarters varies from case to case, but, with the exception of C-NAFs, should not exceed 99 manpower authorizations without an approved waiver from AF/A1M.  The size of the C-NAF headquarters staff is not limited to 99 manpower authorizations. 
2.2.6.  Wing. A level of command below the NAF or higher headquarters.  A wing has a distinct mission with significant scope.  A wing is usually composed of a primary mission group (e.g., operations, training) and the necessary supporting groups.  By pulling together the mission and support elements, a wing provides a significant capability under a single commander.  It is often responsible for maintaining the installation. A wing will have several squadrons in more than one dependent group. (T-1). Wings will have a minimum adjusted population of at least 1,000 per Paragraph 2.2.15. (T-1). A wing may be either an operational wing, an air base wing, or a specialized mission wing. 
2.2.6.1.  Operational Wing. A wing that has an operations group and related operational mission activity assigned to it. When an operational wing performs the primary mission of the base, it usually maintains and operates the base. In addition, an operational wing is 
capable of self-support in functional areas like maintenance, supply and conventional munitions, as needed. When an operational wing is a tenant organization, the host organization provides it with varying degrees of base and logistics support. 
2.2.6.2.  Air Base Wing. A wing that performs a support rather than an operational mission. It maintains and operates a base. An air base wing sometimes provides functional support to a MAJCOM headquarters. 
2.2.6.3.  Specialized Mission Wing. A wing that performs a specialized mission and usually does not have aircraft or missiles assigned to it. For example, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance wing; training wing and so on. This wing may be either a host wing or a tenant wing, depending on whether it maintains and operates the base. 
2.2.7.  Group. A level of command between wings and squadrons. Groups bring together multiple squadrons or other lower echelon units to provide a broader capability. For instance, a mission support group pulls together several squadrons in a variety of areas to provide a full spectrum mission support capability. A group is generally a tactical echelon without significant staff support. A group has two or more subordinate units. (T-1). Groups will have a minimum adjusted population of at least 400 per Paragraph 2.2.15. (T-1). 
2.2.7.1.  Dependent Group. A dependent group is a mission, maintenance, mission support, medical, or large functional unit (e.g., communications) that encompasses a number of related squadrons to provide the specified capability to a parent wing. Such groups may possess small supporting staff elements, such as standardization and evaluation or quality control that are organized as sections. 
2.2.7.2.  Independent Group. An independent group has the same functions and responsibilities as a like-type wing but its scope and size do not warrant wing-level designation and associated overhead costs. 
2.2.8.  Squadron. The basic unit in the Air Force. Squadrons are the basic “building block” organizations in the Air Force, providing a specific operational or support capability. A squadron may be either a mission unit, such as an operational flying squadron, or a functional unit, such as a civil engineer, security forces, or maintenance squadron. A squadron has a substantive mission of its own that warrants organization as a separate unit based on factors like unity of command, functional grouping and administrative control, balanced with efficient use of resources. Squadrons vary in size according to responsibility, but will have a minimum adjusted population of at least 35 per Paragraph 2.2.15.  (T-1). Do not fragment a capability into multiple squadrons when a single squadron provides a parent wing or group commander the best approach in terms of a coordinated, focused capability under single direction. In extreme cases, when squadron population exceeds 700 manpower authorizations, MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs may request establishment of two squadrons. Functional squadrons will employ the 7-series numbering convention in these instances; i.e., “XX” and “7XX” Squadrons. (T-1). 
2.2.9.  Flight. If internal subdivision is required, a flight may consist of sections, then elements. A flight may be either a numbered flight, named flight, alpha flight, or a functional flight. 
2.2.9.1.  Numbered/Named Flight. The lowest level unit in the Air Force. A numbered or named flight primarily incorporates smaller elements into an organized unit that is 
constituted by a DAF/A1M letter. Its administrative characteristics, such as strength reporting, are like those of a squadron.  As a unit, it is authorized a commander.  Functions requiring unit status that are not large enough to be squadrons may be considered for numbered/named flight level.  Because a numbered/named flight is a unit, it must be assigned to an establishment at group level or higher rather than to a squadron.  (T-1). Examples:  497th Combat Training Flight, Air Mobility Command Contracting Flight. 
2.2.9.2.  Alpha Flight. Part of a squadron (usually a mission squadron) and composed of several elements performing identical missions. Because an alpha flight is not a unit, it is not subject to unit reporting.  Example:  A Flight in an operations squadron. 
2.2.9.3.  Functional Flight. Usually part of a squadron and composed of elements performing specific missions. Because a functional flight is not a unit, it is not subject to unit reporting.  Example:  Manpower and Personnel Flight in a force support squadron. 
2.2.10.  Center.  A named unit that performs a specialized mission. Typically used for a larger function that performs most of its mission at one location and has few subordinate units such as the Space and Missile Systems Center. However, extremely large centers such as those for sustainment, life cycle management and test may have multiple subordinate units and non-units at several locations. 
2.2.11.  Laboratory. An organization that performs a research or advanced development mission. 
2.2.12.  Region. A term sometimes used when organization is geographic. 
2.2.13.  Complex.  A named unit that performs a related set of missions within a number of specialized facilities predominantly on one installation. Predominantly used for sustainment, research or development missions; for example, the air logistics complexes and the Arnold Engineering Development Complex. 
2.2.14.  Named Component Headquarters.  A named unit that serves as an Air Force component to a Unified Combatant Command (UCC).  It is a command echelon under a MAJCOM.  Named component headquarters plan, command, control, execute and assess air, space, and information operations across the full range of military operations.  Air Force forces and units are assigned or attached as required to support the UCC. 
2.2.15.  Organization Size Guidance for Wings, Groups and Squadrons. 
2.2.15.1.  Adjusted population minimums are 1,000 for wings, 400 for groups and 35 for squadrons.  Adjusted populations include: 
2.2.15.1.1.  Manpower authorizations as reflected in the Manpower Programming and Execution System (MPES). 
2.2.15.1.2.  Average daily student load (ADSL) or, for the USAF Academy, cadets or preparatory school cadet candidates.  For the purpose of figuring adjusted populations for this AFI: 
 

Note:  ADSL can be included only for training courses approved at MAJCOM level or higher and for which the unit has significant student oversight responsibilities. 
2.2.15.1.3.  A percentage of the contractor workforce.  Specifically, one-third of the Contract Manyear Equivalents (CME) reflected in MPES for a unit may be counted when: 
2.2.15.1.3.1.  The CME portion counts for no more than 30% of the adjusted population used to meet unit size minimums.  In other words, before CMEs may be considered, adjusted populations are at least 700 for wings, 280 for groups and 25 for squadrons. 
2.2.15.1.3.2.  The Contracting Officer’s Representative resides in the unit.  (Also referred to as Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative.  For more information see AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program; the Federal Acquisition Regulation; and the Defense Acquisition Regulation Supplement.) 
2.2.15.1.3.3.  This guidance recognizes the role of contractors in mission accomplishment while reflecting the reduced supervisory responsibilities.  It also ensures USAF units are made up of predominantly USAF assets.  (Note:  SAF/AQ is developing guidance for Contractor Full-time Equivalent (CFTE) reporting which is anticipated to replace CME information at a later date.  When this occurs, use CFTE information in place of CME information for the guidance in Paragraph 2.2.15.1.3.) 
2.2.15.2.  Additional specialized guidance: 
2.2.15.2.1.  A unit reflected as a squadron in the Force Tabs may maintain its squadron status regardless of size.  (The Force Tabs are maintained by SAF/FMP as part of the Program Data System per AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming, Assignment, Distribution, Accounting and Termination.) 
2.2.15.2.2.  A wing with other dependent groups may have an operations group if it has multiple squadrons reflected in the Force Tabs, regardless of the operations group’s size. 
2.2.15.2.3.  An Associate unit may be a squadron if the unit whose weapons system(s) it shares is a squadron.  Refer to AFI 90-1001, Responsibilities for Total Force Integration, for further information on associated units. 
2.2.15.2.4.  Additional specialized guidance for ANG and AFRC units.  The use of standard wing/group organization structures in the Air Reserve Components (ARC) enhances their ability to transition smoothly to the expeditionary environment and interface with Regular Air Force (RegAF) duty forces, although ARC wings and groups are often smaller due to factors such as a more experienced work force with a smaller trainee population, fewer aircraft at a location, and smaller installation 
support infrastructure.  ARC units follow standard unit size and organizational guidance in all other respects, except: 
2.2.15.2.4.1.  Specialized adjusted population minimums for ANG and AFRC units are 750 for wings and 200 for groups. 
2.2.15.2.4.2.  An ANG or AFRC wing with other dependent groups may have an operations group if it has at least one operations squadron that is reflected in the Force tabs or is an associate squadron, plus at least one other unit (e.g., operations support squadron).  This is similar to the guidance for RegAF operations groups but reflects that many ARC wings have only one flying unit. 
2.2.15.2.4.3.  Adjusted populations for ANG units may include a percentage of the state employees.  This recognizes the contribution of state employees while reflecting the differing roles and supervisory aspects. 
2.2.15.2.4.3.1.  Specifically, one-third of the state employees for a unit may be counted when the state employee portion counts for no more than 30% of the adjusted population used to meet unit size minimums.  In other words, before state employees may be considered, adjusted populations (excluding CMEs) are at least 525 for wings, 140 for groups and 25 for squadrons. 
2.2.15.2.4.3.2.  CMEs are excluded from the adjusted population when assessing if the state employee portion counts for no more than 30% to ensure units are made up predominantly of assets directly associated with USAF.  The specified percentages of state employees and CMEs may be included in the final total adjusted population if the minimums have been met. 
2.2.15.2.5.  Additional specialized guidance for medical units: 
2.2.15.2.5.1.  Medical squadrons will follow the standard size guidance and applicable standard structures in this AFI. (T-1) 
2.2.15.2.5.2.  Regardless of size, medical groups are authorized when all of the following are met: 
2.2.15.2.5.2.1.  The organization reports to a wing per Figure 3.3 (Wing Structure) in this AFI. 
2.2.15.2.5.2.2.  The organization is structured per the medical group standard structures in this AFI. 
2.2.15.2.5.2.3.  The organization has multiple subordinate squadrons that meet standard size guidance and follow the standard structures in this AFI. 
2.2.15.2.5.3.  Medical wings will follow the standard size guidance for wings and have multiple subordinate groups. (T-1).  [Note:  The specialized medical unit guidance does not apply to ARC units per Figure 3.29 of AFI 38-101 which specifies the standard medical group structures do not apply to the ARC.  As a result of the organization threshold review (OTR) of medical units, AF/SG addresses the ARC medical units and their structure in the Medical Flight Path.] 
2.2.15.2.6.  Additional specialized guidance for comptroller squadrons.  This additional guidance applies to comptroller squadrons to recognize their fiduciary 
requirements and responsibility for wing staff administration.  Comptroller squadrons that provide administrative and UCMJ support to their parent wing headquarters staff IAW AFI 38-101, Paragraph 3.4.11, may adjust their population to include one-third of that wing staff’s funded military manpower authorizations.  This additional population can account for no more than 30 % of the adjusted population needed to meet squadron size minimums.  In other words, before wing staff may be considered, a comptroller squadron has at least 25 funded manpower authorizations. 
2.2.15.2.7.  Additional specialized guidance for overseas units with Foreign National Indirect Hire civilian employees.  Adjusted populations for overseas units may include a percentage of Foreign National Indirect Hire employees.  This recognizes the contribution of those employees while reflecting the differing roles and supervisory aspects. 
2.2.15.2.7.1.  Specifically, one-third of Foreign National Indirect Hire employees for a unit may be counted when the Foreign National Indirect Hire employee portion counts for no more than 30% of the adjusted population used to meet unit size minimums.  In other words, before they may be considered, adjusted populations (excluding CMEs) are at least 700 for wings, 280 for groups and 25 for squadrons. 
2.2.15.2.7.2.  CMEs are excluded from the adjusted population when assessing if the Foreign National Indirect Hire employee portion counts for no more than 30% to ensure units are made up predominantly of assets directly associated with USAF.  The specified percentages of Foreign National Indirect Hire employees and CMEs may be included in the final total adjusted population if the minimums have been met. 
2.2.15.3.  MAJCOM/A1Ms will monitor unit sizes on an ongoing basis to ensure units are named and organized per the guidance in this Instruction. 
2.2.15.4.  AF/A1M will review wing, group and squadron sizes every two years to ensure compliance with organization size guidance.  Approval levels for waivers to wing, group and squadron size guidance are shown in Table 2.1.  AF/A1M provides guidance on how to submit waiver requests during the biennial reviews.  Paragraph 6.2.1.4. provides guidance on requesting wing, group and squadron size waivers that are needed as part of an Organization Change Request at other times.

2.2.15.5.  Expeditionary Units.  MAJCOMs should strive to organize expeditionary units per the organization size guidance but may authorize variances when necessary due to factors such as operational needs, relationships with other Service or coalition forces, or 
to avoid turbulence due to population fluctuations.  (See Chapter 8 for general guidance on provisional units.) 
2.3.  Standard Elements of Air Force Organization.  The following terms describe the organizational elements within command and staff functions. 
2.3.1.  Command: 
2.3.1.1.  Commander. An officer who occupies a position of command pursuant to orders of appointment or by assumption of command according to AFI 51-604.  This designation is used in all Air Force units except: 
2.3.1.1.1.  US Air Force Academy, which is commanded by a superintendent. 
2.3.1.1.2.  Other school organizations, which may be commanded by commandants.  (Note:   Commandants of non-unit school organizations are not commanders.) 
2.3.1.1.3.  A unit with a civilian leader. When a civilian is appointed to lead a unit, that individual is the director of the unit. A unit designated to be led by a civilian director will not have a commander, section commander or detachment commander. (T-0). (Note: Internal functional flight heads using the duty title of “flight commander” may continue to use this title since they are not unit commanders with commensurate legal command authority.) 
2.3.1.1.3.1.  MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU headquarters may approve designation of a unit to be led by a civilian director instead of a military commander subject to the restrictions within this AFI or other applicable guidance. HQ USAF approval under the waiver process in this AFI is required for approval under any other circumstances. 
2.3.1.1.3.2.  Civilian unit directors must be full-time Department of the Air Force appropriated fund employees who have completed any applicable probationary periods. (T-1). Civilian unit directors must be United States citizens. (T-1). 
2.3.1.1.3.3.  A unit will not have a civilian unit director and must have a military commander if: (T-1). 
2.3.1.1.3.3.1.  The unit is committed as a unit to a combat mission or to fill a mobility requirement. (T-1). 
2.3.1.1.3.3.2.  The unit or an organization subordinate to the unit has a flying mission. (T-1). 
2.3.1.1.3.3.3.  The unit has a medical mission. (T-1). 
2.3.1.1.3.3.4.  The unit is above wing level. (This restriction does not apply to Air Force FOA and MAJCOM FOA headquarters units.) (T-1). 
2.3.1.1.3.3.5.  The unit is one whose leader would normally function as an installation commander. (T-1). 
2.3.1.1.3.3.6.  The unit is an expeditionary or provisional unit. (T-1). 
2.3.1.1.3.3.7.  The unit is in the Air Force Reserve Command or Air National Guard. (This restriction does not limit traditional Reserve and ANG 
Technician arrangements; see AFI 51-604 for additional guidance specific to Air Reserve Component commanders.) (T-1). 
2.3.1.1.3.4.  Since civilians cannot exercise command over military members, and no member of the unit or subordinate unit can assume command of the unit, a succession plan for leadership of the unit should be established in the event the civilian leader is incapacitated.  Refer to AFI 51-604 for guidance on command authority matters for units led by civilian directors. 
2.3.1.1.3.5.  Civilian unit leaders will use an Office Symbol Code (OSC) of CL, Civilian Unit Leader. (T-1). Civilian unit leaders will not use the title Commander nor an OSC of CC (Commander). (T-1). 
2.3.1.1.3.5.1.  Since units with civilian leaders do not have commanders, the titles and OSCs for Vice Commander (CV) and Deputy Commander (CD) cannot be used for either military or civilian members in such units. When authorized, a primary subordinate who shares the civilian director’s duties and acts for the director in the director’s absence will use the title Deputy Director and the OSC of DD.  (T-1). The title Vice Director and OSC of DV may be used for such a primary subordinate at center or wing level. 
2.3.1.1.3.5.2.  Civilians who are subordinates in units commanded by officers cannot use the titles Vice Commander, Deputy Commander, Deputy to the Commander or any similar title which denotes or implies the ability to exercise command authority in a Commander’s absence.  Such civilians may use a title of Deputy and OSC of DD. 
2.3.1.2.  Vice Commander. An officer who shares a commander's duties and acts for the commander during the commander's absence. If eligible and command is properly assumed or appointed under the provisions of AFI 51-604, a vice commander may exercise all command authority during the assigned commander’s absence. This designation is used at major command through wing level only. 
2.3.1.2.1.  Where the Air Force is the lead service at a joint base, the officer (irrespective of branch of military Service) designated the "Deputy Joint Base Commander" performs the functions of vice commander at wing level. 
2.3.1.3.  Installation Commander. The host unit commander responsible for maintaining and operating the installation. This individual discharges the duties directed by US statutes or Air Force directives to be performed by the installation commander. 
2.3.1.4.  Deputy Commander. An officer who shares the commander’s duties and acts for the commander during the commander’s absence. If eligible and command is properly assumed or appointed under AFI 51-604, a deputy commander may exercise all command authority during the assigned commander’s absence. This designation is used at group level. 
2.3.2.  Staff: 
2.3.2.1.  Chief of Staff (CSAF). Title held by the Chief of Staff, US Air Force, with the only variance for Component NAFs.  (See Figure 3.2 for variance for Component NAFs.) 
2.3.2.2.  Deputy Chief of Staff (DCS). An officer who oversees a major portion of the Air Staff and who reports directly to the CSAF. A DCS supervises the activities of directorates and field operating agencies. 
2.3.2.3.  Director of Staff (DS) A staff element reporting directly to the MAJCOM Vice Commander. The function oversees executive services, orderly room and command section activities.  Wings may use this title when authorized under Air Force Manpower Standards (AFMS). 
2.3.2.4.  Directorate. A staff element at HQ USAF or major command level. This is a decision making level which performs a range of related staff functions. Normally, a directorate supervises the activities of divisions and field operating agencies. 
2.3.2.4.1.  Directorates are also authorized in large HQ USAF field operating agencies and in large centers and laboratories (approximately 500 authorizations) which oversee major mission areas and key Air Force programs or support functions. 
2.3.2.5.  Division. Normally aligned as a staff element in HQ USAF, a MAJCOM, NAF, center, FOA or equivalent. Divisions supervise the activities of branches if the organization is large enough to require branches. Organizations that hold squadron status in the wing structure can be aligned as divisions when the head of the organization is a civilian (e.g., Services Divisions). 
2.3.2.6.  Branch. A staff element that performs a specific portion of a division's mission. Branches may be further subdivided into sections and elements. Branches supervise the activities of sections and elements. However, sections and elements are only authorized if the organization performs technical, highly specialized workload or if the supervisor-to-worker ratio exceeds 1:10. If further subdivision of a branch is required, a team-leader approach is the preferred arrangement. 
Chapter 3 
STANDARD ORGANIZATIONS 
3.1.  Organization Structure.  This chapter prescribes standard organizational structures for use to the lowest level shown. Illustrative figures include approved organizational titles (Figure 3.1 through Figure 3.36).  Organization structures are illustrated to the lowest mandatory levels. HQ USAF and MAJCOM functional and Manpower, Organization and Resources focal points are authorized to develop standard organization structures below the mandatory level. This chapter also reflects standard office symbol codes. 
3.1.1.  Organizational Variations. Each figure depicts a standard organizational structure for a particular unit or function. AF/A1M must approve any variations from standard structure. Variations from standard structures should have a clear, overriding purpose that has easily recognizable and defensible organizational and cost benefits.  MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs submit variation requests as described in Chapter 6 of this Instruction when a standard function does not exist at a location, when functions are combined due to small size, or when units are responsible for activities not accounted for in standard structures. 
3.1.2.  Functions and Responsibilities. Each figure depicts the standard organizational structure and accompanying paragraphs list typical functions and responsibilities performed by an organization. These functions and responsibilities are not comprehensive, but are intended to give an understanding of activity that fits in each organizational block. 
3.1.3.  The standard squadron organizational structures prescribed in Chapter 3 also apply to units with the respective unit kinds that are organized as numbered flights due to organization size guidance.  When the unit is a numbered flight, the internal subdivisions are sections. 
3.1.4.  The standard organizational structures prescribed in Chapter 3 also apply to similarly named units that include Special Operations in their designations. 
3.2.  Numbered/Named Air Force (NAF).  The NAF is a command echelon directly under a MAJCOM that is focused on ensuring the readiness of assigned forces.  It prepares forces for deployment and employment. 
3.2.1.  Basic NAF Structure.  The basic NAF structure is in Figure 3.1. 
Figure 3.1.  Basic NAF Structure (Applies to NAFs that are not C-NAFs). 
 

3.2.2.  Component NAF Structure.  The C-NAF structure is in Figure 3.2. 
Figure 3.2.  Component NAF Structure. 
 

3.2.2.1.  A component NAF (C-NAF) is a specialized category of NAF that is structured to perform an operational and warfighting mission in support of a Unified Combatant Command (UCC).  The C-NAF is a command echelon directly under a MAJCOM.  The C-NAF will plan, command, control, execute and assess air, space and information operation capabilities across the full range of military operations.  The C-NAF normally consists of an AFFOR staff and an AOC as depicted in Figure 3.2.  Air Force forces and units are assigned or attached as required to support the UCC. 
3.2.2.2.  Organization Variations.  Elements of Personal Staff should be reduced or eliminated as much as practical through support agreements and reachback.  The Personal Staff may include Protocol (CCP), Political/Military Advisor (CCT), Staff Judge Advocate (JA), Public Affairs (PA), Historian (HO), Chaplain (HC), Safety (SE), Surgeon (SG), Financial Management (FM), Reserve Affairs (RE), Information Protection (IP) and Inspector General (IG).  The rest of the C-NAF staff should consist of the standard Air Force A1-A9 staff functions (see Figure 4.1 and Paragraph 4.4.3 for information on A-staff OSCs).  A-staff 2-digit functions may be linked (e.g., A3 and A5 as A3/5), but separate functional staffs are maintained.  C-NAFs are authorized to use the Chief of Staff (CS) title as a variance to Paragraph 2.3.2.1 of this Instruction.  C-NAF responsibilities may vary depending on the capabilities provided by the MAJCOM. 
  
3.3.  Standard Wing. 
Figure 3.3.  Wing Structure. 
 

3.3.1.  Standard Wing Structure and Responsibilities.  The standard wing generates and employs combat capability. One commander has the authority and responsibility to command the wing. The standard operational wing structure is a wing with four dependent groups (operations, maintenance, mission support and medical) with related functions and disciplines aligned under the appropriate group. Generally, only the wing staff, comptroller unit and the four group commanders report directly to the wing commander. Thus, the wing commander concentrates on the wing's primary mission and delegates authority to subordinates so they can accomplish their responsibilities. Major wing functions are divided among a few principal subordinates, each accountable for carrying out a specific part of the wing mission. Responsibilities are clearly defined and duplication is avoided.  Note:  While the standard wing is organized for combat operations, its basic structure is applied to all types of wings (for instance, air base and specialized mission wings). 
3.3.2.  Organization Variations. Where applicable, Air Control Squadrons are part of the Operations Group. Where applicable, Munitions Squadrons are part of the Maintenance Group. Where applicable, Aerial Port Squadrons are part of the Mission Support Group.  (Note:  Aerial Port Squadron alignment is under review). 
3.3.3.  Staffing of a Standard Wing. A wing is organized as an operational unit with manpower requirements set at those levels required for mission success. A standard or core manpower level exists for each organization defined in this Instruction (see AFI 38-201, Determining Manpower Requirements). 
 
3.4.  Wing Staff. 
Figure 3.4.  Wing Staff Structure. 
 

3.4.1.  Wing Staff Organization. Wing staff functions report to the wing commander. A wing staff function may be referred to as an office, for example: a public affairs office. The senior staff member is referred to as the chief.  (Note:  the below reflects separate wing staff functional offices; it does not reflect individual positions/activities immediately under the CC or CV as reflected by CC_ or CV_ office symbol codes, such as the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (CVS), Drug Demand Reduction Program (CVD), or Installation Resilience Program (CVB).)

3.4.2.1.  For wings that do not have a Comptroller Squadron or that have a civilian-led Comptroller Squadron, wing staff personnel are attached to the Force Support Squadron.  In this case, if the Force Support Squadron is civilian-led, the wing staff personnel are attached to the Mission Support Group headquarters unit. 
3.4.2.2.  MAJCOM/A1s, in coordination with their MAJCOM/JAs, may approve variances to the above wing staff attachments if necessary to avoid inappropriate reporting relationships such as between spouses.  The variances should last the minimum time needed to avoid the inappropriate relationship. 
3.4.2.3.  If a wing does not have any of the units specified in Paragraphs 3.4.11. or 3.4.11.1, the wing commander may attach wing staff personnel to another unit for administrative and UCMJ purposes 
3.4.2.4.  Guidance in Paragraph 3.4.2 concerning attachment of wing staff personnel to Comptroller Squadrons also applies to RegAF comptroller units designated as flights instead of squadrons due to organization size guidance in Paragraph 2.2.15 of this AFI.

Chapter 4 
TERMINOLOGY AND PROCEDURES FOR ORGANIZATION ACTIONS 
4.1.  Organization Actions.  Use the terminology and related procedures outlined in this chapter to make an organization change.  Implementation of actions is to be in accordance with applicable provisions of AFI 10-503, Strategic Basing.  Procedures and responsibilities shown below apply to MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs.  SAF/AAR may perform these functions for their supported organizations. 
4.2.  Organization Terminology: 
4.2.1.  Constitute. Provide the legal authority for a new unit by designating it in a Department of the Air Force (DAF/A1M) letter. 
4.2.2.  Disband. Withdraw the legal authority for a unit. The designation of the unit is retired and preserved in historical records. 
4.2.3.  Reconstitute. Renew legal authorization of a disbanded unit. 
4.2.4.  Activate. Bring into existence a constituted unit, a detachment of a unit, or a provisional unit. An active unit can legally function as specified by directives. 
4.2.5.  Inactivate. End the existence of a unit, detachment of a unit, or provisional unit. An inactive unit retains its lineage, history and honors and is available for activation when needed again. Units should be inactivated when their mission ceases to exist and all resources are withdrawn. 
4.2.6.  Designate. Give an official name (or a number and name). 
4.2.7.  Redesignate. Change the name or number. 
4.2.8.  Consolidate. To permanently combine two or more organizations by merging their lineage into a single line to form a single organization. Consolidation usually applies to organizations that were active at different times but have the same numerical designations or similar functions.  Units that have been active concurrently cannot be consolidated.  A consolidated unit cannot subsequently be separated. 
4.2.9.  Assign. Place a unit with an existing military organization. 
4.2.10.  Attach. Place a unit, or part of a unit, with a military organization other than its parent organization, without making it a part of that organization. A unit, or part of a unit, may be attached for operational control, administrative control and logistic support. 
4.2.10.1.  Operational Control. The authority of a commander at any echelon at or below the level of CCMD to perform those function of command over subordinate forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives and giving direction necessary to accomplish the mission. 
4.2.10.2.  Administrative Control. Direction or exercise of authority over subordinate or other organizations in respect to administration and support.  Examples of administrative control are UCMJ authority, personnel classification, effectiveness reports, granting leaves and so on. 
4.2.10.3.  Logistic Support. The support provided by one organization to another, enabling that organization to carry out operations. Examples include supply, maintenance, logistics planning, transportation and contracting. An order that states a unit is attached for logistic support only clearly means operational control and administrative control are not responsibilities of the commander to which the unit is attached. The order itself does not detail the extent and kind of logistic support, as this support is clarified through separate documents, such as host tenant support agreements. 
4.2.11.  Allot.  Authorize a unit to be part of the Air National Guard.  DAF/A1M memos allot units to the National Guard Bureau which in turn allots them to the appropriate state, territory or the District of Columbia. 
4.2.12.  Status Change.  Change the organizational status of a MAJCOM, FOA or DRU.  A status change is accomplished by a DAF/A1M memo.  Status changes are often accompanied by a redesignation.  For example, the status change of the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency from a FOA to a subordinate organization of Air Combat Command (ACC) was accompanied by its redesignation to Twenty-Fifth Air Force. 
4.3.  Organization Procedures.  The following procedures apply to organization entities within the Air Force. 
4.3.1.  Establishments: 
4.3.1.1.  An establishment is automatically created when its headquarters unit is activated. 
4.3.1.2.  An establishment is controlled through its headquarters. However, subordinate units are assigned to the establishment, not to the headquarters unit. This enables each unit within an establishment to have a separate identity. The fact that the headquarters unit controls the establishment places the other units subordinate to it. Personnel are assigned to a unit, not to an establishment. 
4.3.1.3.  The assignment of any establishment assigns all its components at the same time, unless otherwise specified. For example, when a wing is assigned to an NAF, the assignment of the wing's groups and squadrons also is to the NAF. The separation of units by location does not affect their assignment to the establishment. 
4.3.1.4.  Inactivation of a headquarters unit automatically inactivates the establishment. Units assigned to the establishment automatically revert, unless otherwise directed, to the next higher level. 
4.3.2.  Units: 
4.3.2.1.  HQ USAF issues a DAF/A1M letter to constitute and activate MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs. For a unit subordinate to a MAJCOM, FOA or DRU, HQ USAF constitutes the unit and assigns it to the MAJCOM, FOA or DRU for activation. The MAJCOM, FOA or DRU will activate and assign the unit by issuing a G-Series Order citing the DAF/A1M letter as authority. (T-1). A DAF/A1M letter also can authorize a MAJCOM, FOA or DRU to redesignate or inactivate a unit. An inactivated unit reverts to the control of HQ USAF. DAF/A1M letters and G-Series Orders follow the formats prescribed in Chapter 7. 
4.3.2.2.  A MAJCOM, FOA or DRU may reassign a unit internally unless the unit's assignment is specified in a DAF/A1M letter or by a standard structure prescribed in this Instruction. 
4.3.2.3.  A unit may be reassigned from one MAJCOM, FOA or DRU to another. In this case, the losing MAJCOM, FOA or DRU (after coordinating with the gaining MAJCOM, FOA or DRU) requests AF/A1M approve the reassignment on a date agreed to by both commands (if agreed to by both parties, the gaining command may make the request or the commands may make a joint request). If only unit reassignments are involved, the DAF/A1M letter directs the reassignment of such units and copies are sent to both commands. If reassignment and movement occur at the same time, the movement directive issued per AFI 16-403 can also serve as the reassignment directive. 
4.3.2.4.  The effective date of an organization action (for example, activation, inactivation, or redesignation) is either published in the DAF/A1M letter or in orders issued by the MAJCOM, FOA or DRU. When a DAF/A1M letter allows the effective date to be on or about a certain date, the organization action must occur no more than 30 calendar days before or after that date. (T-1). 
4.3.2.5.  Numbered flights are units and require the same organization procedures as other units. Alpha and functional flights, however, are not units and are not subject to this chapter's procedures. 
4.3.3.  Nonunits: MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs have the approval authority to activate, inactivate, and redesignate detachments and operating locations (OL) (see below for specifics such as how to designate them and restrictions on redesignations).  MAJCOM Manpower and Organization focal points should conduct an annual detachment/OL review to validate the continuing requirement for the activity.  MAJCOM, FOA and DRU Manpower and Organization focal points and SAF/AARM (for serviced organizations) may approve variances to paragraphs 4.3.3.1.2. and 4.3.3.2.6 below regarding sequencing of detachment and OL designations if warranted due to factors such as operational needs, to maintain continuity, or to identify with a particular related organization or location (such as joint bases); detachments remain numeric and OLs remain alphabetical. 
4.3.3.1.  Detachments: 
4.3.3.1.1.  A MAJCOM, FOA or DRU may activate a detachment for a function that is geographically separated from its parent unit. A detachment is activated to fill a need for command or supervision, or for other reasons, such as to facilitate unit movement. If there is a need for command authority, the senior officer on duty with a detachment is appointed on orders as detachment commander. Note: Normally, a geographically separated organization is designated an operating location unless on-site command authority is required. Then, it is designated a detachment. 
4.3.3.1.2.  Detachments are numbered in sequence, beginning with 1. 
4.3.3.1.3.  A detachment can be redesignated to another number within the same unit. The new number cannot duplicate a currently active detachment number within that unit. 
4.3.3.1.4.  The following redesignations cannot be made: 
4.3.3.1.4.1.  A detachment of one parent unit to a detachment of another parent unit. 
4.3.3.1.4.2.  A detachment to a unit. 
4.3.3.1.4.3.  A unit to a detachment. 
4.3.3.1.4.4.  A detachment to an operating location. 
4.3.3.1.4.5.  An operating location to a detachment. 
4.3.3.1.5.  The inactivation of a parent unit automatically inactivates its detachments. 
4.3.3.1.6.  Detachments are designated as part of a unit, not an establishment, e.g., Detachment 1, 1st Fighter Squadron or Detachment 4, HQ 1st Operations Group. 
4.3.3.1.7.  If a gap in sequential numbering occurs due to actions such as inactivation of a detachment, it is not necessary to take actions to change the numbers of the other detachments in the unit to fill in the gap. 
4.3.3.2.  Operating Location (OL): 
4.3.3.2.1.  An OL may be activated by a MAJCOM, FOA or DRU. 
4.3.3.2.2.  An OL is a geographically separated location where persons are required to perform permanent duty and the command supervision or other features provided by a detachment are not needed. 
4.3.3.2.3.  An OL is not a location separated from an installation to which persons are transported to work. 
4.3.3.2.4.  Guidelines in Paragraphs 4.3.3.1.3. to 4.3.3.1.7. above regarding detachments also apply to operating location actions (with the understanding that OLs are designated alphabetically instead of numerically). 
4.3.3.2.5.  Manpower authorizations for an OL are reported with the location where duty is being performed. 
4.3.3.2.6.  OLs are designated in alphabetical sequence, beginning with A. 
4.3.3.3.  Coding Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) Data 
4.3.3.3.1.  The PAS code contains data fields for designating detachments, OLs and staff elements. The following coding rules apply: 
4.3.3.3.2.  OLs are designated with a maximum of three alphabetic characters in a four-character field. The first character of the OL field is zero. The first two characters of the OL field are always zero for OLs designated with two letters. The first three characters of the OL field are always zero for OL designations with a single letter (e.g., OL code “000A” for OL-A, OL code “00ZZ” for OL-ZZ, OL code “0ABC” for OL-ABC). 
4.3.3.3.3.  If the OL is not subordinate to the detachment, the detachment code is designated with zeroes (e.g., detachment code “0000” and OL code “000A” means OL A and parent is not a detachment). 
4.3.3.3.4.  If the OL is subordinate to the detachment, both fields are designated independently (e.g., detachment code “0001” and OL code “000A” equals OL A of detachment 1). 
4.3.3.3.5.  Detachment and OL data fields (four characters each) are combined in the personnel system. Therefore, total non-zero characters cannot exceed four characters. 
4.3.3.3.5.1.  An OL can be up to three characters if the detachment number designation is one digit (1-9). 
4.3.3.3.5.2.  An OL can be one or two characters if the detachment number designation is two digits (10 through 99). 
4.3.3.3.5.3.  An OL can be only one character if the detachment number designation is three digits (100 through 999). 
4.3.3.3.5.4.  An OL cannot be assigned to a detachment numbered greater than 999. If it should become necessary to establish an OL, the detachment is redesignated using not more than three digits for identification. 
4.3.3.3.5.5.  The first character of an OL or staff element data field is alphabetic if used for anything other than an OL (e.g., when establishing a separate PAS for a senior rater). 
4.3.3.3.5.6.  General guidance on the PAS system is in AFCSM 36-699, Volume 4, Personnel Accounting Symbol System Users Manual. 
4.3.3.4.  Squadron Sections.  A commander of a large unit (235 or more military authorized), squadron or above, may delegate administrative control of all assigned members by appointing a section commander on special orders IAW guidance in AFI 51-604. 
4.3.3.4.1.  If a full-time section commander is not authorized under a manpower standard, unit commanders may appoint a section commander who performs these functions as an additional duty.  Commanders should exercise discretion to ensure this is done only when warranted by span of control factors. 
4.3.3.4.2.  See AFI 51-604 for legal guidance on appointment of section commanders.  See AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), for guidance on AFSC/duty title matters. 
4.3.3.5.  Air Force Elements: 
4.3.3.5.1.  An Air Force Element may be designated to function as a unit by a designating officer (described below).  The designating officer attaches the Air Force members on duty with an organization outside the Air Force to the Air Force Element.  (Refer to AFI 51-604 for the determination of an Air Force Element commander and/or the appointment of Air Force Element section commanders.)  The following officers have authority to designate an Air Force Element to function as a unit: 
4.3.3.5.1.1.  The Senior Air Force Officer (SAFO) in a defense agency, defense field activity, unified or specified combatant command, joint task force, combined task force, coalition force, or activity outside the Air Force that exercises 
operational control over the Air Force Element. 
4.3.3.5.1.2.  The commander of the Air Force MAJCOM for active duty members within that command detailed to a unit of the Air National Guard not in federal service; detailed to an organization outside the Air Force for which the Secretary of the Air Force serves as the Executive Agent pursuant to Department of Defense Directives; or similar circumstances. 
4.3.3.5.1.3.  The Commander, Air Force District of Washington for Air Force Elements not within such commands, agencies or activities. 
4.3.3.5.2.  In appropriate circumstances (such as a geographically dispersed Air Force Element), an Air Force Element may be divided into sections and an Air Force Element section commander appointed to each section.  In these cases, the Air Force Element commander designates which members are attached to each section. 
4.4.  Office Symbol Codes.  Office Symbol Codes (OSCs) identify the organization structure and functional responsibilities within a unit.  For instance, “HO” is the OSC for the History Office in the wing headquarters.  The following specifically addresses OSCs as used in MPES and related manpower documentation.  (Note:  Office Symbol Codes were formerly called Organization Structure Codes.) 
4.4.1.  General Characteristics of OSCs. 
4.4.1.1.  Major functions have two-letter symbols, e.g., surgeon--SG.  Since basic functions report to major functions, basic functions have three-letter (or more) symbols, e.g., dental--SGD.  A basic function’s office symbol starts with the same letters as the parent function’s office symbol, and adds one more letter. 
4.4.1.2.  Each major function within the Air Force is assigned a two-letter office symbol; wing staff, group, and squadrons within the operations group and mission support group have two-letter office symbols.  Basic functions are assigned three-letter (or more) office symbols.  Some major functions include basic functions that are similar in title and function to another major function (e.g., the major function of manpower, personnel and services, A1, may have a basic function of plans).  Since all office symbols within a function start with the same two letters, the personnel plans function should use the office symbol A1X rather than XP so the basic function is not confused with a major function. 
4.4.1.3.  The OSC CC may be used for organizational commanders instead of the functional OSC.  MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs should be consistent among their like-organizations in use of CC or the functional OSC in MPES. 
4.4.1.4.  To the extent possible, OSCs use the same letters and titles at HQ USAF, MAJCOM, and base-level. 
4.4.1.5.  Types of OSCs.  There are two types of OSCs: 
4.4.1.5.1.  Air Force Standard OSCs are available for use by more than one command.  These types of OSCs are established for standard organization structures such as those in Chapter 3 of this AFI or a functional AFI and to promote standardization and ease of communication.  These OSCs are identified by a command code of “HQ” in the MPES OSC Reference Table. 
4.4.1.5.2.  Command-unique OSCs are used by a single command, as identified in the MPES OSC Reference Table.  Command-unique OSCs cannot duplicate or conflict with standard OSCs.  Do not create a command-unique OSC if an Air Force standard OSC exists for an organization; e.g., if a Civil Engineer Squadron has an Operations Flight, it uses an OSC of CEO as reflected in Chapter 3. 
4.4.2.  Procedures for MPES OSCs: 
4.4.2.1.  MPES OSCs are limited to 7 alphanumeric characters.  Though special characters such as dashes or slashes may be acceptable when OSCs are used for communication or identification purposes, they cannot be included in OSCs as reflected in MPES because they create problems in some data systems that interface with MPES. 
4.4.2.2.  MPES OSC titles are limited to 40 characters for Air Force systems and a 100 character title for interface with DoD systems.  To facilitate interface with the DoD systems, the 100 character title should be spelled out as much as possible, avoiding acronyms and other abbreviations.  Special characters cannot be used in MPES OSC titles because they create problems in some data systems that interface with MPES. 
4.4.2.3.  Organizational level should not normally be included in the OSC title; i.e., do not include words like Division, Directorate, Squadron, Flight, Section, etc., in the title.  This allows the same OSC to be used at different organizational levels. 
4.4.2.4.  Using organizations should request deletion of OSCs that are no longer required.  The deletions cannot occur until there are no longer any manpower authorizations using the OSC. 
4.4.2.5.  Existing OSCs should be used when possible. 
4.4.2.6.  HQ USAF functional managers should maintain standard OSCs/structures down to the division or equivalent level (i.e., offices with three-digit OSCs) for MAJCOM and NAF headquarters to facilitate communications and minimize personnel transition time.  The HQ USAF functional manager must approve all deviations to these established three-letter office symbols (see Paragraph 6.1.3). 
4.4.2.7.  Do not use proposed OSCs until approved. 
4.4.3.  A-Staff OSCs.  A-staff OSCs are used to identify certain major staff elements in HQ USAF, MAJCOM headquarters and C-NAF headquarters.  These OSCs are patterned on the J-staff structure used in joint organizations and are designed to improve communication within the Air Force and with other DoD organizations.  Base-level organizations do not use A-Staff OSCs.  Functions not covered by the standardized A-staff structure maintain their current office symbols (e.g., FM, JA, SG, PA, etc.).  Standard 2-letter A-staff OSCs are shown in Figure 4.1.  MAJCOMs may request to link A-staff 2-digit functions (e.g., A3 and A5 as A3/5) in their MAJCOM headquarters using the organization change request procedures in Chapter 6.  MAJCOMs are authorized to approve linking A-staff 2-digit functions in their C-NAFs if they follow the guidance in Figure 3.2.  MAJCOMs may return to the standard A-staff structure in Figure 4.1. without using the organization change request procedures in Chapter 6 but they must notify AF/A1M of the return to the standard structure. 
Figure 4.1.  Standard 2-Letter A-Staff OSCs. 
A1 – Manpower, Personnel and Services 
A2 – Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance 
A3 – Operations 
A4 – Logistics, Engineering and Force Protection 
A5 – Plans and Requirements 
A6 – Communications 
A8 – Strategic Plans and Programs 
A9 – Studies, Analyses, Assessments and Lessons Learned 
A10 – Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration (Limited to HQ USAF and approved MAJCOM headquarters) 
 
 

4.4.4.  Requests for MPES OSC Actions: 
4.4.4.1.  If an OSC change is needed because of an Organization Change Request (OCR), requesters include the associated OSC actions in question 5 of the OCR per the procedures in Chapter 6 of this AFI. 
4.4.4.2.  MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs and SAF/AAR send other OSC requests for MPES actions via e-mail to the AF/A1MO Workflow mailbox.  The e-mail should have a distinct subject reflecting the request and requester; e.g., subject:  OSC Request - ACC OS Add; OSC Request - AFMC PK Actions.  The e-mail should include:  the specific OSC, OSC titles, action (add, delete, change), a short rationale for the request, and whether requesting a standard or command-unique OSC (identify command code, as appropriate).  A spreadsheet request template is available from AF/A1MO, their Air Force Portal site or SharePoint site.  AF/A1MO obtains functional coordination within HQ USAF, as required, and forwards approved requests to be loaded into MPES.  Note:  OSC requests for organizations outside the Air Force (e.g., Air Force Elements) should be sent to AF/A1MP instead of AF/A1MO. 
Chapter 5 
PROCEDURES FOR NAMING AND NUMBERING UNITS 
5.1.  Nomenclature.  Standardize organization titles, when possible. When activating a unit, designate it using the procedures in this Instruction and guidance in AFPD 38-1. 
5.2.  General Guidelines.  Apply the following guidelines when naming a unit: 
5.2.1.  Generally, units require a specific organization title or designation made up of a number or name, a "kind" (nomenclature) and a "type" (organizational level) indicator. Examples of a numbered and named unit designations are in Figure 5.1. 
Figure 5.1.  Unit Designation Examples. 
Numbered Unit Designation Example: 
Title: 2d Bomb Wing 
Number: 2 
Unit Kind: Bomb 
Unit Type: Wing 
------------------------------------------- 
Named Unit Designation Example: 
Title: Ogden Air Logistics Center 
Unit Kind: Ogden Air Logistics 
Unit Type: Center 
 
 

5.3.  Unit Number: 
5.3.1.  A numbered unit is assigned a number of no more than three numerals (for example, 305th Air Mobility Wing). 
5.3.2.  USAF designates Numbered Air Forces in a single series beginning with "First."  Do not use Arabic or Roman numerals in designating Numbered Air Forces.  C-NAFs have a parenthetical designation indicating their component role consisting of "(Air Forces XXXXX)" where "XXXXX" is the functional or geographic designation of the associated Unified Combatant Command; e.g., Eighteenth Air Force (Air Forces Transportation) or Seventh Air Force (Air Forces Korea).  NAFs that are not C-NAFs cannot have a parenthetical designation; e.g., Second Air Force. 
5.3.3.  Use unit numbers as low in sequence as possible. 
5.3.4.  Reserve numbers 101 through 299 for Air National Guard units. 
5.3.5.  Do not duplicate wing and independent group numerical designations.  In other words, there is only one 388th wing (presently a fighter wing) or one 720th group (presently a special tactics group). Since these numbers are taken, no other 388th or 720th wing or group is authorized.  AF/A1M manages active wing designations. 
5.3.6.  Give groups and support squadrons the same number as their parent organizations, when possible. If you cannot give groups their parent organization's number (e.g., due to duplication) do not use a number already assigned to another wing. Assign to these groups or 
squadrons a number that bears a logical relationship to the parent. When feasible, number duplicate units 7XX or 8XX (where XX is the wing number). For example, duplicate squadrons under the 96th Civil Engineer Group would be the 96th Civil Engineer Squadron and 796th Civil Engineer Squadron. 
5.3.7.  Do not normally give mission squadrons assigned to groups or wings the same number as their parent organizations. When otherwise convenient, use sequential numbers for mission squadrons within the same wing.  Examples of mission squadrons include operational squadrons in a flying wing, training squadrons in a training wing, and software maintenance squadrons in a maintenance wing. 
5.3.8.  You may not normally redesignate a unit numerically.  For example, if the host wing at a base changes, the support units are not redesignated from the old host wing number to the new host wing number.  Instead, the support units under the old host wing are inactivated and support units with the new host wing number are activated.  This ensures that the previous host wing has like-numbered support units available for activation if needed. 
5.3.9.  Normally number units subordinate to a NAF 6XX (where XX is the NAF number).  Do not use 6XX numbers for units not assigned to XX NAF (where XX is the NAF number). 
5.3.10.  Use the heritage priorities in AFPD 38-1 to assign unit numerical designations for wings, independent groups and operational squadrons. 
5.4.  Unit Kind: 
5.4.1.  Assign a unit nomenclature that describes its assigned mission.  Do not construct unit titles that restrict another unit with a like mission from using that nomenclature. 
5.4.2.  Do not designate composite wings or composite independent groups by "kind" designation (for example, 3d Wing). 
5.4.3.  Keep unit "kinds" (nomenclature) and type attributes short and simple. Use more specific nomenclature at lower organizational levels, but keep the number of different titles to a minimum. 
5.4.4.  Use current, approved nomenclature for units.  For available unit "kinds" (nomenclatures) see the Organization Kind Code Reference Table in MPES.  Units must have approval from AF/A1M for any deviations to approved nomenclature.  (T-1). 
5.5.  Unit Type:  Use Chapter 2 of this Instruction to determine appropriate unit types. 
5.6.  New Nomenclature.  If an unusual factor such as a special mission suggests a deviation from the standard organization nomenclature, a MAJCOM may request new nomenclature from AF/A1M.  Include in these requests the proposed nomenclature (unit kind), type (level), command to which restricted (if any) and a short definition of the mission implied by the nomenclature. Also include the justification or rationale for the proposed nomenclature.  Include this information in question 5a of an Organization Change Request IAW the procedures in Chapter 6 of this Instruction.  For example: 
Proposed Unit Kind: Fighter Training 
Proposed Unit Type: Squadron 
Command Restriction: None. 
Definition: Provides flying training in fighter type aircraft. 
Justification: Provide rationale for new nomenclature. 
5.7.  Procedures for Unit Designation:  Units are regularly activated, inactivated, or redesignated as a result of force structure and organizational changes.  Designation actions will conform to policy criteria in AFPD 38-1 and procedural criteria documented in this Instruction. (T-1). 
5.7.1.  Do not designate or redesignate a unit with the exact number, name and type of another active or inactive unit. 
5.7.2.  When a new unit is needed, you may re-activate an inactive unit of the same number or name and similar function.  It may be redesignated before activation to reflect current nomenclature when needed.  The unit that is activated again keeps its lineage, honors, history and emblem.  When proposing a unit activation, MAJCOMs should contact the Air Force Historical Research Agency (AFHRA) as early in the process as possible for identification of appropriate inactive units that are available.  “Similar function” for inactive flying units means re-activation as a unit whose members operate aircraft, spacecraft or other flying equipment operating in the air or space environments.  Other types of mission units and support units do not use the heritage of former flying units. 
5.7.3.  A unit retains its lineage, honors and history through all activations, inactivations and redesignations.  AFI 84-101, Historical Products, Services, and Requirements, describes the effect an organizational action has on inheriting the lineage, honors and history of a unit.  Upon request, the Air Force Historical Research Agency provides MAJCOMs with a list of qualified inactive units for possible activation. 
5.7.4.  MAJCOMs will use approved nomenclature and heritage lists to propose unit designations.  Submit these proposals to AF/A1M for evaluation and certification of compliance with guidance in AFPD 38-1 and this Instruction according to procedures in Chapter 6.  If MAJCOMs wish to deviate from the guidance, they must provide explicit justification in a request for approval of an organizational variance.  AF/A1M sends proposals to the Chief of Staff for approval. 
5.7.5.  Requests to memorialize a named unit or named activity are to follow the guidelines in AFI 36-3108, Memorialization Program and Ceremonies.  MAJCOMs submit these requests according to the procedures in Chapter 6 of AFI 38-101 and include a biography of the individual, explanation of why the MAJCOM wishes to memorialize the organization for this individual, and certification that appropriate quality force reviews or background checks have been conducted. 
Chapter 6 
ORGANIZATION CHANGES 
6.1.  Actions Requiring AF/A1M Approval.  MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs and their subordinate units (through their Manpower, Organization and Resources office) must have AF/A1M approval to: 
6.1.1.  Activate, inactivate, or redesignate a unit or to vary from any policy, guidance, procedure, or standard organization depicted in this Instruction or AFPD 38-1.  A variation includes any addition, deletion, or merger of functions shown in a standard organization. (T-1).  AF/A1M staffs these requests to appropriate approval authorities within HQ USAF as shown in Table 6.1.

6.1.2.  Change major staff elements (directorate or equivalent level; i.e., offices with two-digit office symbols) in a MAJCOM headquarters. 
6.1.3.  Also, HQ USAF functional managers must approve changes to MAJCOM headquarters at the division or equivalent level (i.e., offices with three-digit office symbols).  MAJCOMs submit these requests to the appropriate HQ USAF functional manager with an information copy to AF/A1MO or to AF/A1M via the procedures in this chapter. 
6.2.  Organization Change Request (OCR).  A request for organization action such as unit activation, inactivation, redesignation, or variation to a standard structure should include answers to the following questions, as they apply. Answer “Not Applicable” when appropriate.  AF/A1M reviews organization change requests and, upon approval, direct MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs or SAF/AAR to reflect the action in the RCS:  HAF-A8X(M)9227 Report, Programming Actions Involving Units, Installations, and Unit Equipment per AFI 16-403.  Also, MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs are required by AFI 84-105, Organizational Lineage, Honors, and Heraldry, to submit to the Air Force Historical Research Agency a monthly report of any changes in organizations using RCS: HAF-HO(M)7401, Air Force Organization Status Change Report.  Implementation of actions should be in accordance with applicable provisions of AFI 10-503. 
6.2.1.  Organization Change Request Questions.  (MAJCOMs should edit submissions from their base-level organizations before forwarding requests to HQ USAF to ensure questions are answered completely and that information extraneous to HQ USAF review is deleted.) 
6.2.1.1.  Question 1:  What is the proposed action (list specific actions, such as activation, inactivation, nomenclature change, reorganization, or variation request)? 
6.2.1.2.  Question 2:  Why is the action needed? What are the expected benefits? (Identify factors driving the need for the action, e.g., changes to Instructions, missions or concepts of operations; attach any substantiating Air Force directives. In describing expected benefits, identify improvements, examples of increased mission capability and so on. Generalized statements such as increases mission capability or reduces span of control are not adequate as justifications.) 
6.2.1.3.  Question 3:  What is the structure of the new organization (include current and proposed organization and function charts showing authorized and proposed manpower by officer, enlisted and civilian.  Also include Average Daily Student Load, where applicable.  Explain manpower changes. To assist in identification of potential Congressional or community concerns, identify the number of manpower authorization changes for each affected installation in your response; use a table if needed.)? 
6.2.1.4.  Question 4:  Explain how the proposed structure compares with standard structure, nomenclature and size guidance and provide rationale for any requested deviations. Using the guidance in Chapter 2, include computation of adjusted populations for wings, groups or squadrons with manpower authorizations under the unit size thresholds. 
6.2.1.5.  Question 5:  As a result of this request, are any changes needed to add or delete Organization Nomenclature Codes or Office Symbol Codes (OSCs) or to change the title for an OSC; if so, provide the following information.  Strive to use existing codes rather than creating new ones.  Avoid special characters due to data system interface problems.  (See Chapter 4 for additional information on OSCs.) 
6.2.1.5.1.  Question 5.a.  Organization Nomenclature Code Change: 
Action:  [Add or Delete; titles cannot be changed] 
Title: 
 

6.2.1.5.2.  Question 5.b.  OSC Change: 
 

6.2.1.6.  Question 6:  For unit activations or redesignations, explain why the proposed unit designation was chosen.  Identify any inactive historical units you’re proposing to use and explain why you want to use these units. (Coordinate proposals with the appropriate history office.) 
6.2.1.7.  Question 7:  What is the cost of the request in terms of dollars and resources? (Document cost in terms of dollars and manpower.  Include administrative costs such as flags and signs, as well as manpower increases or monetary costs directly driven by the requested reorganization action.  Do not include costs that may be a result of related force structure, for example, runway construction costs for bedding down programmed aircraft would not be included in the OCR to activate an associated flying squadron. If the action cannot be implemented from within currently programmed MAJCOM, FOA or DRU resources, see paragraph immediately below.) 
6.2.1.7.1.  MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs normally implement actions approved under the OCR process using currently programmed manpower and budgetary resources. In the rare cases when this is not possible, they submit an initiative for the resources needed to the Air Force Corporate Structure during a budget exercise, following guidance in AFI 16-501, Control and Documentation of Air Force Programs, and any related instructions. This is done prior to or concurrent with the OCR submission. AF/A1M will hold the OCR without action until the resources are approved. AF/A1M will return the OCR with-out action if the resource approval does not occur within 30 calendar days of receipt of the OCR. For reconsideration, the MAJCOM, FOA or DRU resubmits the OCR following approval of the resources. 
6.2.1.8.  Question 8:  Provide a mission directive, statement or description for organizations being activated, inactivated, redesignated or reorganized. 
6.2.1.9.  MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU A1Ms and SAF/AARM (for serviced organizations) submit OCRs requiring AF/A1M action per Paragraphs 6.1.1-2 using a request memo 
from the A1M or SAF/AARM to AF/A1MO.  These submissions reflect their commands’ position and are to have been staffed with appropriate offices internal to the command (including affected command functional points of contact) prior to submission to HQ USAF.  AF/A1MO coordinates the OCRs with appropriate HQ USAF offices and staffs the OCR to the approval authorities reflected in Table 6.1 for a decision on approval or disapproval. 
6.2.1.9.1.  If approval authority is the VCSAF, CSAF or SECAF, the submitting MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU includes documentation reflecting approval to release the OCR by their commander, director, vice commander or equivalent.  A copy of the command staff summary sheet for the action is the preferred documentation and is included as an attachment to the OCR submission memo. 
6.2.1.9.2.  OCRs for AFRC and ANG units include coordination by the Gaining Commands for the affected units.  HQ AFRC/A1M and NGB/A1M obtain the coordination from the Gaining Command A1Ms who staff the requests within their command, including appropriate functional coordination.  The Gaining Command A1Ms obtain coordination from their commander or vice commander if the approval authority for the action per Table 6.1 is the VCSAF, CSAF or SECAF.  The MAJCOM commander or vice commander may delegate the coordination of these OCRs to the command A1M; the command A1M provides a copy of the delegation to AF/A1MO, HQAFRC/A1M and NGB/A1M and updates the delegation at least every five years.  (Note:  See AFPD 10-3, Air Reserve Component Forces; AFI 10-301, Responsibilities of Air Reserve Component (ARC) Forces; and AFI 90-1001, Responsibilities for Total Force Integration, for further discussion of Gaining Commands.  This term is under review for AFRC units.  If guidance is subsequently modified to change the Gaining Command term for AFRC units, the same responsibilities will apply to organizations with the revised term; however, if AFI 10-301 guidance directing Gaining Command review of organizational structure is eliminated as it applies to AFRC, the corresponding requirement for Gaining Command coordination of AFRC OCRs in this paragraph of AFI 38-101 will no longer be required.) 
6.2.1.9.3.  MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs and SAF/AARM are encouraged to use supplements to this AFI or similar documents to provide guidance to their organizations on OCRs that do not require HQ USAF approval, as well as command-unique organization structures, terms and processes. 
6.2.1.9.4.  Figure 6.1 is a checklist of tips for preparing an OCR.  This is not all-inclusive and supplements the questions in Paragraphs 6.9.1.1-8 above.  Following these tips helps reduce staffing delays that occur when additional information or corrections need to be requested. 
  
Figure 6.1. OCR Preparation Tips (use with questions in paragraphs 6.9.1.1-8). 
 

6.2.2.  A request for organization action is not required in the following instances: 
6.2.2.1.  For units inactivating as a result of an approved force structure action.  Actions subject to legislative action or related studies are not considered approved until satisfactory completion of the legislative requirements.  If actions are not in accordance with heritage priority guidance in AFPD 38-1, an OCR is required. 
6.2.2.2.  When organizational impacts have been addressed as part of actions approved under AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program (see that publication for specific guidance on required information). 
6.2.2.3.  When specific unit actions are directed in a Program Action Directive, Program Guidance Letter, Program Change Request, or similar directive issued by HQ USAF. 
6.2.3.  A MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU, after notifying AF/A1M, may return a changed organization to a prescribed configuration. 
6.2.4.  Additional requirements may need to be met for establishment of a new FOA, DRU, MAJCOM FOA, or MAJCOM DRU.  The annual Defense Appropriations Act usually contains a provision prohibiting expenditure of funds for establishment of such organizations.  The provision permits the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) to grant a waiver if SECAF certifies to Congress that the establishment results in personnel or financial savings to the Department of the Air Force.  Existing FOAs, DRUs, MAJCOM FOAs and MAJCOM DRUs will not be redesignated or re-missioned to an unrelated mission area to circumvent this legal direction. (T-1).  Contact AF/A1MO for the current guidance when considering establishment of one of these organizations. 
6.2.5.  Units will not take actions such as scheduling ceremonies, inviting dignitaries, or making public announcements prior to appropriate HQ USAF approval of organization changes. (T-1). 
6.2.6.  MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs ensure all notification requirements are followed for organization actions.  Consult current guidance including CJCSI 2300.02H, Coordination of Overseas Force Structure Changes (OFSC) and Host-Nation Notification; AFI 10-503, Strategic Basing; AFI 10-504, OFSC and Host Nation Notification; AFI 16-601, Implementation of, and Compliance with, International Arms Control and Nonproliferation Agreements; and current Congressional notification/public announcement requirements (as applicable).  Take these requirements into account when planning implementation timing.  For instance, the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty requires the U.S. make notifications on affected organization changes 42 days in advance of the implementation date and additional time needs to be allowed for processing the notification through EUCOM, the Joint Staff, and the State Department after OCR approval.  (Note:  MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs work CFE notifications with HQ USAFE per guidance in AFI 16-601.) 
6.2.7.  MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs also use the Organization Change Request procedures for reassignment of units or named activities to another MAJCOM, FOA or DRU.  The losing command normally prepares the OCR.  If agreed to by both parties, the gaining command may prepare the OCR or the commands may submit a joint OCR.  In all cases, the submitting command must coordinate the OCR with the other command prior to submission and include this coordination with their OCR submittal to AF/A1M. (T-1). 
6.3.  Testing New Organizations.  MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs may develop and test new organizations. The purpose of an organization test is to evaluate the new organization's effectiveness under actual working conditions and resolve most common problems before committing affected functions to change. A test involving an organization structure found in this Instruction requires AF/A1M approval. Submit test plans for approval at least 120 calendar days before the proposed start of the test. The test plan should include: 
6.3.1.  Answers to the questions in Paragraph 6.2.1., as they apply. 
6.3.2.  Dates of the test period (not to exceed 1 year). 
6.3.3.  Objective measures to assist in evaluation of the test. 
6.3.4.  After completing the test period, the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU sends results and recommendations to AF/A1M. A waiver request is included if a permanent organization change is desired. 
Chapter 7 
ORGANIZATION DOCUMENTATION 
7.1.  Implementation Authority.  HQ USAF, MAJCOM, FOA and DRU manpower and organization functions are responsible for publishing the legal and authoritative documents needed to implement organization actions. 
7.1.1.  Department of the Air Force (DAF/A1M) Letters. DAF/A1M letters constitute, reconstitute, disband, consolidate, activate, inactivate, redesignate, assign and reassign (between MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs) Air Force units.  In addition, DAF/A1M letters designate, redesignate, inactivate, assign and reassign (between MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs) named activities.  DAF/A1M letters serve as authority for MAJCOM, FOA and DRU unit and named activity organization actions. DAF/A1M letters follow the formats outlined in Figure 7.1. through Figure 7.5. 
7.1.1.1.  Effective Date. The effective date of an organization action is either published in the DAF/A1M letter or in the order issued by a MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU. When a DAF/A1M letter allows the effective date to be on or about a certain date, the organization action must occur no more than 30 calendar days before or after that date. (T-1). 
7.1.1.1.1.  MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs and SAF/AARM notify HQ USAF/A1MO of their desired effective dates by providing HQ USAF/A1MO a courtesy copy of their RCS:  HAF-A8X(M)9227 Reports submitted in accordance with AFI 16-403.  The desired effective dates should be projected a minimum of two months in advance but no less than one day in advance. 
7.1.1.1.2.  An on or about date in a DAF/A1M letter is at least 30 calendar days from the date of the letter.  This provides the maximum flexibility for commands submitting their desired effective dates with less than a month’s notice while preventing the final effective dates from being earlier than the date the DAF/A1M letter is issued. 
7.1.1.1.3.  If a MAJCOM, FOA, DRU or SAF/AARM needs to change an effective date outside the dates allowed by a DAF/A1M letter on or about date, it submits the new desired date and reason for the change in an amendment to its RCS:  HAF-A8X(M)9227 Report using the instructions in AFI 16-403.  This amendment should be submitted before the last day within the on or about period for DAF/A1M letters with on or about dates or before the effective date if the original DAF/A1M letter did not have an on or about date. 
7.1.1.1.4.  If a DAF/A1M letter allows an effective date to be on or about a certain date and the MAJCOM, FOA, DRU or SAF/AARM fails to issue a special order providing the final date within the on or about period, then the on or about date in the DAF/A1M letter becomes the final effective date. 
7.1.1.1.5.  DAF/A1M letters activating, inactivating, redesignating or changing the status of MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs provide a specific effective date and do not 
have on or about dates.  This is because these types of organizations are directly subordinate to HQ USAF, which is the issuing authority for DAF/A1M letters. 
7.1.2.  G-Series Orders. These orders are published to activate, inactivate, redesignate, assign and reassign units, detachments and named activities subordinate to a HQ USAF, MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU; and to attach one organization to another. A MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU manpower and organization function may authenticate and publish G-Series Orders using the formats in Figure 7.6 through Figure 7.12.  SAF/AAR may perform these functions for their supported organizations.  In addition, AFI 33-328, Administrative Orders, provides general guidelines about orders preparation.  ANG units follow additional guidance in ANG Supplement to AFI 33-328.  (Note: Unit moves and movement orders are covered by AFI 16-403.) 
7.1.2.1.  Guidelines for G-Series Orders: 
7.1.2.1.1.  Numbering G-Series Orders. Orders are numbered in sequence starting with number one (for example, GS-1, GS-2 and so on). Begin a new sequence each fiscal year. 
7.1.2.1.2.  Effective Date. The effective date of the action described in the order is the date of the order, unless a different effective date is specified. 
7.1.2.1.3.  Distribution. Send all organizations impacted by the order a copy.  Use of standard distribution lists is encouraged. Orders involving medical units include the Air Force Medical Support Agency on distribution.  All orders (and DAF letters) are sent to AFHRA (address AFHRA/RSO, 600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB, AL 36112-6424 or e-mail:  afhra.rs@us.af.mil). 
7.1.2.2.  G-Series Order Organization Actions: 
7.1.2.2.1.  Activation and Assignment. Include the title of organization, station, unit or establishment of assignment, effective date and authority (Figures 7.6. and 7.9.). 
7.1.2.2.2.  Redesignation. Include the old and new unit or detachment designation; the station, unit and establishment of assignment, as applicable; the effective date; and the authority (Figures 7.7. and 7.9.). (See Paragraph 4.3.3.1.4. for additional guidance regarding redesignation of detachments.) 
7.1.2.2.3.  Inactivation. Include the designation of organization being inactivated, the station, the effective date, the disposition of personnel and equipment, statement that funds are to be disposed of according to Air Force directives and the authority (Figures 7.8. and 7.9.). 
7.1.2.2.4.  Reassignment. Include the designation of the establishment from which the unit is relieved, the establishment to which the unit is assigned, the effective date of transfer and the authority (Figures 7.9. through 7.11.). 
7.1.2.2.5.  Attachment of One Unit to Another. Include the unit and MAJCOM to which attached, the effective date of attachment, the purpose of attachment and the authority (See sample orders in Chapter 8). 
7.1.2.2.6.  Detachments and Operating Locations.  (See Figure 7.12.) Detachments and operating locations are designated as part of a unit, not an establishment, e.g., 
Detachment 1, 1st Fighter Squadron or Operating Location A, HQ 1st Operations Group.  This is because detachments and operating locations are parts of a unit, not separate units.  Special orders are not required for Operating Location actions because there is no associated UCMJ authority; however, MAJCOMs may publish orders for announcement or accountability purposes. 
7.2.  Distribution Requirements  . Each MAJCOM manpower and organization function ensures HQ USAF/A1MO is on distribution to receive special orders, MAJCOM organization charts, mission directives and Instructions relating to organizations within their command. 
7.3.  Headquarters Department of the Air Force Organization Chart.  This publication prescribes AFVA 38-104, HQ USAF Organization Chart. AFVA 38-104 shows HQ USAF offices under the Secretariat and the Air Staff down to the 3-letter level, along with their respective Field Operating Agencies (FOAs). SAF/AAR prepares this AFVA semiannually or as needed.

Chapter 8 
ORGANIZING PROVISIONAL UNITS 
8.1.  Provisional Unit.  A provisional unit is temporary in nature and created when a specific organization is required for a temporary mission and no organization exists to attach forces (including personnel).  All personnel are attached to the provisional unit and remain assigned to their permanent unit. 
8.1.1.  References to assigned and attached units in this chapter refer to the organizational structure of the provisional organization which establishes the Air Force chain of command.  Assigned and attached units should not be confused with assigned and attached forces. 
8.1.2.  Provisional units are organized in the same manner as permanent units.  Establish provisional organizations at the organization level required to meet mission requirements (i.e., NAF, wing, group, squadron, flight, detachment, operating location).  Organize provisional operations, maintenance, mission support, medical groups, and subordinate squadrons under a provisional wing, as needed.  Related functions may be consolidated into a single unit if more efficient due to size, oversight, or other factors; e.g., all maintenance functions can be combined into a maintenance squadron when the size of the functions do not warrant separate maintenance, aircraft maintenance and maintenance operations squadrons.  If only a portion of a squadron is required, those functions may be added to an existing provisional squadron or to the next higher provisional unit.  For example, if an entire expeditionary force support squadron is not required, manpower, personnel, and services functions could be assigned into an expeditionary mission support group. 
8.1.3.  A provisional unit is attached rather than assigned to a permanent unit.  Conversely, a permanent unit cannot be assigned to a provisional unit, but it may be attached to a provisional unit.  A subordinate provisional unit is assigned to a higher provisional unit. 
8.2.  Types of provisional units.  There are two types of provisional units (traditional and expeditionary). 
8.2.1.  Traditional.  When there is a need for a temporary organization not associated with a contingency type situation.  An organization change request (OCR) to HQ USAF or Department of the Air Force (DAF) letter is not required for this type of provisional unit.  For example, 
8.2.1.1.  When two or more organizations merge and the need exists to create a temporary organization pending final disposition of resources from the merging organizations. 
8.2.1.2.  When an organization is needed for short-term requirement such as a temporary headquarters until a location is selected for the permanent headquarters.  (Note: A provisional unit should not be established to pre-suppose approval of a permanent basing decision.) 
8.2.2.  Expeditionary.  Provisional organizations established in support of a contingency or exercise operation.  There are two types of expeditionary units (major force provider and rainbow).  (Note:  Additional guidance for use of provisional units during contingency 
operations is provided in AFI 38-205, Expeditionary Manpower Management, and AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution.) 
8.2.2.1.  Major Force Provider.  An expeditionary unit that draws the preponderance of its forces or command element from a single active unit.  This wartime or contingency organization uses the unit designation of the unit providing the preponderance of forces (major force provider) or the command element.  (Discussed further in 8.7.3.1.) 
8.2.2.2.  Rainbow.  An expeditionary unit formed from multiple force providers.  This wartime or contingency organization does not have an identifiable major force provider.  These organizations are inactive historical units converted to provisional status and assigned to, and activated by MAJCOMs as expeditionary organizations.  (Discussed further in 8.7.3.2.) 
8.2.2.3.  MAJCOM A1Ms will establish procedures for requesting the establishment of expeditionary units assigned or attached to subordinate AETFs. 
8.2.3.  MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs will forward copies of G-series orders to AF/A1MO, AFHRA (address AFHRA/RSO, 600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB, AL 36112-6424 or e-mail:  afhra.rs@us.af.mil), all units mentioned in the order, and other offices and units as needed.  (Discussed further in 8.11.)  (T-1). 
8.3.  PAS Codes  .  Provisional units have the same command relationship characteristics and PAS code requirements as permanent units.  MAJCOMs request provisional PAS codes per current instructions.  PAS codes are assigned and registered in the PAS system.  The PAS code for provisional units is represented by an "H" in the fifth digit of the eight digit PAS instead of an "F" (i.e., "EP2CHR9C" vs. "EP2CFR9C").  The use of "H" serves two primary purposes:  provides distinction between provisional units and regular units; and keeps the provisional PAS code compatible with the joint reporting systems. 
8.4.  History  . 
8.4.1.  Traditional provisional organizations as described in 8.2.1. are temporary and once inactivated, their lineage ceases and may not be revived.  Any provisional unit of this type using the same nomenclature as a previous provisional or permanent unit may not claim the lineage, history, or honors of that unit. 
8.4.2.  Major force provider expeditionary organizations as described in Paragraph 8.2.2.1. are temporary and once inactivated, their lineage ceases and may not be revived; however, any honors earned by this type of expeditionary provisional organization are conferred upon its single major force provider of the same organizational level (squadron to squadron; group to group, etc.) in accordance with AFI 84-105, Organizational Lineage, Honors, and Heraldry.  For this purpose, wings are considered on the same organizational level as groups and squadrons on the same organizational level as numbered flights. 
8.4.3.  Rainbow expeditionary organizations temporarily converted from permanent to provisional organizations as described in 8.2.2.2. retain all lineage, history, and honors of the permanent unit and, when returned to permanent status, retain all lineage, history, and honors earned while in provisional status.  Honors earned by a rainbow unit are retained by the rainbow unit and are not shared with units that provided personnel for the expeditionary organization. 
8.4.4.  For specifics on lineage, honors, and heraldry refer to AFI 84-105, Organizational Lineage, Honors, and Heraldry. 
8.5.  Designations.  MAJCOMs will title provisional units to reflect their functional mission.  To the maximum extent possible, use existing nomenclature.  Traditional provisional units include the term provisional in the unit designation to indicate the unit is provisional, for example, Headquarters 849th Mission Support Group (Provisional) or HQ 849 MSG (P).  MAJCOMs must submit an organization change request to AF/A1M IAW Chapter 5 of this AFI for approval to create new unit nomenclatures (organization kind). 
8.5.1.  For traditional provisional units, MAJCOMs should select a unit designation that cannot be confused with another unit and does not have the same designation as an active unit. 
8.5.2.  Designate expeditionary units as directed in Paragraph 8.7. and Figure 8-1. 
8.6.  Air Expeditionary Task Force (AETF).  An AETF may be established as an Air Force service component to a joint task force (JTF), or as a subordinate task force within a larger Air Force service component to address specific internal tasks.  If an AETF is formed as the former, the AETF commander is also a commander, Air Force forces (COMAFFOR).  Otherwise, the AETF commander is not a COMAFFOR, but reports to a COMAFFOR.  An AETF has a commander, a staff, appropriate command and control mechanisms, and tailored and fully supported forces to meet specific mission requirements.  The AETF is organized into a numbered expeditionary air force (NEAF), air expeditionary wings (AEW), air expeditionary groups (AEG), and air expeditionary squadrons (AES), or other organizations, as necessary to provide reasonable spans of control.  When directly supporting a unified combatant command, the AETF is attached to the Air Force component.  When an AETF is established to support a joint task force subordinate to a unified combatant command, the AETF may be attached for administrative control directly to the Air Force component to the unified combatant command, or it may be assigned to an AETF established at the unified combatant command level. 
8.6.1.  An AETF is named based on the unit providing the senior command headquarters, its size (NEAF, AEW, AEG), and the operation name. 
8.6.1.1.  For a NEAF level AETF, use the numerical designation of the engaged NAF, followed by Expeditionary Air Force (EAF), then the name of the operation.  For example, a NEAF-sized AETF established under 12AF (AFSOUTH) would be designated as 12 EAF-OPERATION NAME. 
8.6.1.2.  In rare circumstances, a provisional command headquarters may be needed between a NEAF and its assigned and attached forces.  These headquarters are designated as a numbered Air Expeditionary Task Force followed by an operation or location identifier, for example, 9th Air Expeditionary Task Force–Iraq (9 AETF-I).  The 9 AETF-I would be assigned to the 9th Expeditionary Air Force (9 EAF). 
8.6.1.3.  For wing- or group-sized AETFs, use the numerical designation of the engaged wing or group, followed by Air Expeditionary Wing (AEW) or Air Expeditionary Group (AEG), then the name of the operation. For example, a wing or group-sized AETF established under 12AF (AFSOUTH) would be designated the 345 AEW-OPERATION NAME or the 345 AEG-OPERATION NAME. 
8.6.1.4.  While not normally established, a squadron sized AETF would use the designation of the engaged expeditionary squadron followed by the operation name. 
8.6.2.  Refer to appropriate Air Force and Joint doctrine for additional guidance on organization and command relationships. 
8.7.  Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) Organization: 
8.7.1.  Expeditionary units are established to operate with an AETF.  In the following paragraphs, the term “supported command” refers to the Air Force MAJCOM the AF component command is administratively assigned to and which is receiving support (i.e., forces) from other MAJCOMs.  “Supporting command” refers to the Air Force MAJCOM, FOA or DRU providing forces to the supported command. 
8.7.2.  Permanent units supporting or participating in an AETF from their permanent locations are not redesignated as expeditionary units nor are major force provider expeditionary units established at the same location as the corresponding permanent unit.  In-place permanent units supporting or participating in an AETF can be attached to the expeditionary unit they are supporting. 
8.7.3.  Expeditionary units are numbered as follows.  See also Figure 8-1 for detailed guidelines on AEF unit naming and numbering. 
8.7.3.1.  With the exception of support units, the numerical designation for expeditionary units that have a major force provider reflects the designation of the unit that provides the preponderance of forces or the command element to the expeditionary organization.  For example, if the 4th Fighter Wing is the major force provider of an Air Expeditionary Wing, then the nomenclature would be 4th Expeditionary Fighter Wing (EFW).  If there is a mix of forces (e.g., fighter, mobility) then the nomenclature would be the 4 AEW.  The organizational level of the expeditionary unit is the same as the unit providing the preponderance of forces, except for the situations in Paragraphs 8.7.3.1.1.and 8.7.3.1.2. 
8.7.3.1.1.  If size and scope of an operation do not warrant establishment of a wing, a group nomenclature may be used.  For example, if the 4th Fighter Wing is the major force provider of an Air Expeditionary activity that does not have the appropriate scope or size to be designated a wing, a major force provider unit designated the 4th Expeditionary Fighter Group or 4th Air Expeditionary Group could be established. 
8.7.3.1.2.  If the size and scope of an operation do not warrant establishment of a squadron, a numbered flight nomenclature may be used.  For example, if the 4th Civil Engineer Squadron is the major force provider for an expeditionary mission, but size does not warrant a squadron designation, a major force provider unit designated 4th Expeditionary Civil Engineer Flight could be established. 
8.7.3.2.  The numerical designation for expeditionary units that do not have a major force provider reflects the designation of an historic unit activated to form a rainbow unit.  In cases where multiple MAJCOMs deploy forces to the same location, but a single major force provider cannot be identified, the supported MAJCOM will create expeditionary units using historical “rainbow” units allocated for their use by AF/A1MO.  The numerical designation for expeditionary rainbow units retains the numerical designation of the historic unit converted from permanent to provisional status.  MAJCOMs must 
work with their historians and the Air Force Historical Research Agency to identify inactivated units to fill rainbow expeditionary unit requirements to meet highest projected demand and provide those units to AF/A1MO.  AF/A1MO will issue a Department of the Air Force (DAF) numbered letter converting the inactive historic units to provisional units and assigning them to the MAJCOM to activate or inactivate in provisional unit status as needed (Figure 8-2). 
8.7.3.3.  All subordinate dependent groups and support units carry the same numerical designation as the parent expeditionary organization.  For example, support units under the 4th Expeditionary Fighter Wing would be designated the 4th Expeditionary Operations Group, 4th Expeditionary Maintenance Group, 4th Expeditionary Maintenance Squadron, 4th Expeditionary Mission Support Group, 4th Expeditionary Logistics Readiness Squadron, 4th Expeditionary Medical Group. 
8.7.3.4.  If portions of an organization are deployed to different locations, MAJCOMs are authorized to include the name of the operation and location in the unit designation (e.g., 71st Expeditionary Fighter Squadron – Noble Anvil, Location Name). 
Figure 8.1.  Expeditionary Unit Naming & Numbering Guidelines. 
Title 
 Purpose 
 Comments & Examples 
 
xx Air Expeditionary Task Force (AETF).  Can be a NEAF, wing, group or squadron level. 
 
 The generic name of an Air Force Service component presented to a joint task force commander.  An AETF should be presented within the framework described in Air Force doctrine.   
 
 Use the numerical designation of the tasked NAF, wing, group or squadron followed by the operation name (e.g., 12 EAF-OPERATION NAME, 4 AEW-OPERATION NAME, 4 AEG-OPERATION NAME, 336 EAS-OPERATION NAME).  An in-place NAF retains its NAF designation (e.g., 7 AF (AFKOR)). 
 
xx AETF- Operation Name or Location Identifier.  
 Provisional command headquarters between a NEAF and its assigned and attached forces.   
 Use the numerical designation of the parent NEAF followed by the operation name or location (e.g. 9 AETF-Iraq). 
 
xx Air Expeditionary Wing (AEW) or Expeditionary [mission-kind] Wing, e.g. Expeditionary Fighter Wing (EFW). 
 Temporary wing assigned to an AETF. 
 
 Use the numerical designation of the major force provider unit or an authorized rainbow unit, as appropriate (e.g., 345 AEW, 4 EFW) 
 

xx Air Expeditionary Group (AEG) 
 Temporary independent group assigned to an AETF.  An independent group has the same functions and responsibilities as a like-type wing, but its scope and size do not warrant wing-level designation.   
 Use the numerical designation of the major force provider unit or an authorized rainbow unit, as appropriate (e.g., 4 AEG) 
 
xx Expeditionary [functional-kind] Group 
 
 Temporary group assigned to an AETF.   
 
A dependent group is a mission, maintenance, mission support, medical or large functional unit (e.g. communications) that provides the specified capability to a parent wing.  
 
 
An independent functional group is a large functional unit that does not report to a wing; e.g., the 1st Civil Engineer Group under the 9th Air and Space Expeditionary Task Force. 
  
 
 
A dependent group uses the numerical designation of its parent expeditionary wing (e.g., 4th Expeditionary Operations Group, 4th Expeditionary Mission Support Group) 
 
An independent functional group uses the numerical designation of the major force provider unit or an authorized rainbow unit, as appropriate. 
 
xx Expeditionary [mission-kind] Squadron 
 Temporary mission squadron assigned to an AETF.   
 Use the numerical designation of the major force provider unit or an authorized rainbow unit, as appropriate (e.g., 366th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron or 344th Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron) 
 
xx Expeditionary [direct combat support-kind] Squadron 
 Temporary direct combat support squadron assigned to an AETF.   
 Use the numerical designation of the major force provider unit or an authorized rainbow unit, as appropriate  (e.g., 819th Expeditionary RED HORSE Squadron or 5th Expeditionary Combat Communications Squadron) 
 
xx Expeditionary [support-kind] Squadron 
 Temporary support squadron assigned to an AETF.   
 Use the numerical designation of its parent expeditionary wing or group (e.g., 4th Expeditionary 
 

Logistics Readiness Squadron) 
 
Detachment x, xx Expeditionary [functional-kind] [unit type] 
 Temporary dependent detachment of an expeditionary unit.   
 Number in sequence starting with 1.  Use the unit designation of its parent unit (e.g., Detachment 1, 16th Expeditionary Special Operations Squadron) 
 
Operating Location (OL) x, xx Expeditionary [functional-kind] [unit type]  
 Temporary dependent OL of an expeditionary unit   
 Alphabetized in sequence starting with A.  Use the unit designation of its parent unit (e.g., OL-A, 24th Expeditionary Special Tactics Squadron) 
 

8.8.  Attaching/Assigning Provisional Units.  Provisional units are assigned to a higher echelon provisional unit or attached to a higher or same echelon permanent unit.  All expeditionary units are assigned to an AETF or attached under a component NAF and under the administrative control (ADCON) of the Air Force Service component for the geographic region in which forces are based.  If a deployed expeditionary unit is not assigned or attached to the regional COMAFFOR (i.e., the forces are not formally transferred by Secretary of Defense order and the owning unified combatant command retains control) then a host-tenant support agreement is required to define support requirements. 
8.9.  Administrative Control (ADCON)  .  The ADCON responsibilities of the gaining commander can vary by scenario and should be specified in G-Series orders.  The supporting and supported MAJCOMs must work together to ensure the degree of ADCON responsibilities is clearly understood.  Specified ADCON responsibilities are included in AFDD Volume 1, Basic Doctrine. 
8.10.  UCMJ authority resides concurrently with the commanders in the assigned and attached units, and does not need to be explicitly stated in G-series orders.  See 51-series AFIs for specific information on disciplinary and UCMJ matters. 
8.11.  G-Series Orders.  AFI 33-328, Administrative Orders, provides guidance on the preparation of administrative orders.  MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs must publish G-series orders to activate, inactivate, redesignate, assign or attach provisional (including expeditionary) units. (T-1). The G-Series order provides the legal authority for provisional units.  Examples of G-Series orders for provisional and expeditionary units are shown at Figures 8.3. – 8.7.  MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs forward copies of unclassified and classified orders to HQ USAF/A1MO, the Air Force Historical Research Agency (HQ AFHRA/RSO, 600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell, AFB AL 36112-6424), and all units mentioned in the order.  MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs use the Air Force Organization Status Change Report (RCS: HAF-HO (M) 7401) to document the organizational changes to provisional units IAW AFI 84-105, Organization, Lineage, Honors, and Heraldry. 
8.11.1.  G-series orders for expeditionary units are prepared by the supported MAJCOM (reference Paragraph 8.7.1.) or in cases where forces are not attached, by the MAJCOM retaining operational control.  The supporting and supported MAJCOMs must work closely 
together on drafting the G-series orders to ensure ADCON responsibilities are spelled out and the AETF commander’s concept for organization and unity of command are understood. 
8.11.2.  Command Relationships.  The ground rules for command relationships are outlined in Joint Publication 1 and AFDD Volume 1.  The supported and supporting command must work closely together to develop the best organization structure to support mission requirements and build a clear chain of command. 
8.11.3.  Activation and inactivation dates may be specified in the same G-series order. 
8.11.4.  MAJCOMs may add the name of the operation and location to any unit in the G-series orders. 
8.11.5.  G-Series orders should be classified and declassified according to the security classification guidance published for the exercise or operation.  Classified orders have appropriate paragraph marking, classified by, and declassification guidance.  Every effort should be made to declassify the orders as soon as permissible or use a specific event  (i.e. activation date) as the declassification date. 
8.11.6.  G-series orders for recurring and major exercise (when required) units follow the same basic conventions as those used for expeditionary units. 
8.11.7.  A G-series order is not required to establish a provisional or permanent MAJCOM headquarters.  A DAF A1M letter is the authority and establishes the specific MAJCOM headquarters activation date.

Chapter 2 
DETERMINING MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS 
2.1.  Overview.  By definition, a manpower requirement is the manpower needed to accomplish a job, mission, or program.  A manpower requirement can be documented as a funded manpower authorization or an unfunded requirement.  A manpower authorization is a funded manpower position on the Unit Manpower Document (UMD).  The Air Force considers manpower a resource to support approved programs.  Manpower is not a program by itself which can be manipulated apart from the programs it supports.  Manpower is a limited resource which is sized to reflect the minimum essential level to accomplish the required workload. 
2.2.  General Information. 
2.2.1.  Air Force active component manpower planning and programming is centralized at Headquarters Air Force (HAF) where national security policy is translated into force structure programs.  Execution is decentralized to MAJCOMs where budget and resource allocations are translated into command programs and units.  The Air Force Management Engineering Program (MEP) provides manpower standards to help commanders determine manpower requirements. 
2.2.2.  Manpower requirements will only be based on MAJCOM or higher headquarters directives. 
2.2.3.  Air Force Functional Area Managers (FAM) and/or Career Field Managers (CFM) will coordinate on manpower studies with AF/A1M prior to commitment of resources.  This includes services provided by private sector contractors.  For MAJCOM-level manpower studies, MAJCOM functional managers will coordinate with the MAJCOM A1M prior to the commitment of resources. 
2.2.4.  Manpower study lead teams (AFPC/MA, ARF, or MAJCOM) will not release preliminary results, manpower estimates, or manpower requirements without AFPC/MA, AF/A1M, or NGB/A1M approval.  This policy is to ensure integrity throughout the manpower community ensuring only ‘valid results’ are released to Air Force leadership. 
2.2.5.  AF/A1M has approval authority for manpower standards applicable to the Active Component, whether applicable to multiple commands, a single command, or a single location; and NGB/A1M has approval authority for all manpower standards pertaining to ANG units. 
2.3.  Air Force Management Engineering Program.  The MEP provides the framework for developing Air Force manpower standards and analysis tools to systematically identify minimum and essential manpower required to accomplish approved missions. 
2.3.1.  Manpower standards are developed IAW AFMAN 38-208, Air Force Management Engineering Program (Volumes 1-3), which contains specific procedures, methods, tools, statistical requirements and formats for conducting and documenting manpower studies. 
2.3.2.  As part of the MEP, the Logistics Composite Model (LCOM) is an approved Air Force computer simulation program used to develop aircraft maintenance manpower requirements (AMMR) and AETC AMMR models.  Note:  When an LCOM model is not 
available or feasible to determine aircraft maintenance manpower requirements, the maintenance man-hour per flying hour (MMH/FH) requirements computation can be applied.  Specific instructions and an example are located at Attachment 2.  Overarching LCOM program management is delegated to AFPC/MA. 
2.4.  Roles and Responsibilities. 
2.4.1.  AF/A1M. 
2.4.1.1.  Office of primary responsibility and approval authority for the MEP. 
2.4.1.2.  Develops policy and guidance for the Secretary of the Air Force (SecAF) with respect to determining and managing Air Force manpower requirements. 
2.4.1.3.  Reviews all Air Force directives (e.g., AFIs, AFPDs, AFPCNs, and interim changes, etc.) for potential impact on manpower requirements or workload data reporting systems prior to certifying a new manpower standard. 
2.4.1.4.  Provides manpower standard application and implementation guidance to MAJCOMs.

2.4.8.  Installation Manpower Office (MO).  The installation MO advises commanders on the utilization and management of manpower requirements, (T-1); assists study teams with workload measurement, workload factor (WLF) data collection and validation of workload information, (T-1).  Specific MO responsibilities also include:  reviewing AF Forms 9, or other contract purchase requests, when manpower is involved, (T-1); Host-Tenant and Inter-service Support Agreement review, (T-1); Memorandum of Understanding review and analyses for manpower impact, (T-1); civilian position management, (T-1); deployment planning, (T-1); supporting various productivity programs, (T-1); reviewing all manpower action requests for local impact, (T-1); insourcing and outsourcing oversight, (T-1); collection/validation of WLF data when the MAJCOM manpower staff requires collection for application of manpower standards, (T-1); and providing Management Advisory Study (MAS) services for units within their area of responsibility, (T-1).  The term, servicing Manpower Office will be used in those instances where more than one manpower-type office or activity resides on an installation, particularly in those instances where the MO interfaces with other local activities belonging to the same Wing (Civilian Personnel, Contracting, Financial Management (FM), etc.) 
2.4.8.1.  Contract Purchase Request Manpower Review. 
2.4.8.2.  Installation-level Roles and Responsibilities: 
2.4.8.2.1.  Supervisors and/or commanders (Requiring Activity) will submit Contract Purchase Request Packages, to include funding documentation (i.e., AF Form 9, to include modifications and terminations), the independent government estimate, and the performance work statement to the installation/servicing manpower office for validation.   (T-1). 
2.4.8.2.2.  The requiring activity will also provide sufficient technical information (e.g., AFSC, skill-level, FAC, OSC, total contract cost and start/stop dates contract requirements, contract labor cost, contractor full-time staffing, or man-hour estimates, as may be available) to assist the installation/ servicing MO in reviewing the contract request.  (T-1). 
2.4.8.3.1.  The installation/ servicing Contracting Squadron/ Office will: 
2.4.8.3.2.  Process the request for services, including modifications and contract extensions/ terminations, once the installation/ servicing MO has reviewed and validated the request.  (T-1). 
2.4.8.4.  Installation/ servicing Manpower Office will: 
2.4.8.4.1.  Review and coordinate on all service-type contract requests, modifications, or terminations to ensure/ validate the proposed contract work is not performed or funded by the existing in-service workforce.  (T-1).  Particularly, the MO will review to ensure no duplication of manpower or resource expenditure will occur if the request is approved as it is against Air Force policy to pay ‘twice’ for workload to be performed;  i.e., manpower which has been allocated on the unit’s UMD to perform workload, contractors will not be acquired to perform the same work.  (T-1).  The MO will complete their review within 5 workdays of receipt of the purchase request.  (T-1). 
2.5.  The Role and Definition of the Functional Account Code (FAC).  A function is a homogeneous grouping of processes; that is, tasks requiring similar equipment/processes that are grouped together.  A function is most typically located in a centralized area and functional personnel perform work that contributes to the same end product; typically their duties are similar or closely related.  A FAC is used to identify each function and facilitate the analysis and accounting of its manpower requirements.  A FAC title does not equate to (nor should it equate to) an Office Symbol Code (OSC); formerly referred to as an Organizational Structure Code.  With respect to a manpower standard, a FAC indicates where the position is earned (i.e., a particular function).  For example, if positions in a function are earned by manpower standard, the positions will have the FAC of the manpower standard.  If the manpower standard has “X” in the FAC number, the “X” is a place holder.  If a function has more authorizations than were earned, the position(s) must be deleted when the manpower standard is implemented or show another FAC for which the position is earned.  (Note:  An OSC can have more than one FAC; however, this must be kept to a minimum.)  If there is no manpower standard applicable to the function, the FAC will reflect what function the position is earned.  In addition, FAC title nomenclature will not include duty title information or organizational structure information (e.g.,”Chief” in Chief Budget Development or “Division” in Resources Division). 
2.5.1.  FACs are 6-digit codes used to identify functions.  The first four digits describe the Air Force-level function, while the last two digits can identify command-unique functions.  All FACs and their titles are controlled by AF/A1MR through system controls within MPES; the purpose being to standardize and avoid duplication of the codes and titles. 
2.5.1.1.  A FAC indicates where the position is earned (i.e., a particular function) in a work center.  In other words, when a position is earned by manpower standard in a particular function, the position will reflect the FAC of the manpower standard.  Note:  In the event the position is realigned to another FAC for any reason, the original FAC will be changed to reflect the new function; however a notation shall be made in the command remarks code, or local remarks code field in MPES identifying the FAC and OSC the position was realigned from. 
2.5.2.  The first digit of the FAC represents the major groups of functions.  The functional groups are divided into seven categories to identify the major type of work performed. 
 1XXX Command and Command Support 
 2XXX Maintenance 
 3XXX Operations 
 4XXX Mission Support 
 5XXX Medical 
 6XXX Research and Development 
 7XXX Activities Outside the U.S. Air Force 
2.5.3.  The functional category “8XXX” is used to identify the several missions and/or support activities performed by contract personnel under a single contract for operation on Air Force installations; because of the restrictions imposed on its use, it is not considered a major category. 
2.5.4.  The first and second digits of a function code, when combined, represent the basic function of the major grouping (11XX – Information Management, 15XX – Comptroller, etc.).  The third and fourth digits provide the additional detail to identify a specific activity (1110 – Administrative Communications, 1512 – Military Pay, etc.). 
2.5.5.  Submit FAC requests through the respective MAJCOM A1M office to AF/A1MR with the recommended FAC number (if known), FAC title and the FAC definition.  If approved, the AF/A1M Requirements Division (AF/A1MR) will update the FAC information in MPES. 
2.5.6.  AF/A1MR establishes new FACs when warranted within an approved manpower standard.  The FAC for the manpower standard, developed by AFPC/MA, is usually a 4-digit FAC, but can be a 6-digit FAC, with “XX” or “00” as the fifth and sixth digit. 
2.6.  Office Symbol Codes (OSC).  An OSC identifies the organization structure and functional responsibilities within a unit; for instance, ‘HO’ is the OSC for the History Office in the wing headquarters and SE is the OSC for the Safety Office in the wing headquarters.  Refer to AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization, paragraph 4.4., for a further explanation and detail. 
2.7.  The Role and Application of the MAF and Overload Factor (OLF).  AF/A1M is the approval authority for all MAFs.  The Air Force uses different MAFs to define and ultimately quantify the number of full-time equivalents (FTE) a given function requires, as relevant to the use of man-hours.  Dividing the man-hours earned from the application of a manpower standard by the appropriate MAF and overload factor results in FTEs.  AFPC/MA is responsible for developing and quantifying MAF's (e.g., Military Peacetime and Civilian) and special MAF's (e.g., fire protection personnel work a 72-hour workweek) for functions that cross command lines. 
2.7.1.  A MAF is the average number of man-hours, per month, an assigned individual is available to do primary duties (direct and indirect work).  The MAF calculations account for time away from the work center related to leave, medical care, education and training (other than on-the-job training), permanent change of station (PCS), organizational duties, etc.  FN MAFs reflect host nation unique non-availability.  Use AF-approved FN MAFs as appropriate to include special workweeks. 
2.7.1.1.  Attachment 3 contains a detailed explanation of standard, wartime and special Air Force workweeks and/or MAFs that are used in manpower standards development/application. 
2.7.1.2.  Commands will submit requests for new MAFs to AFPC/MA for review.  Each request must contain detailed justification and supporting data for the new MAF and describe the circumstances and personnel availability policies. 
2.7.2.  The overload factor is normally applied in conjunction with certain MAFs during the manpower standards application and ensures effective use of Air Force manpower authorizations.  The overload factor realizes Air Force leadership’s expectation that some overtime is an effective tool instead of adding additional manpower requirements. 
2.7.2.1.  Different standard workweeks have different overload factors. 
2.7.2.1.1.  Use the 7.7 percent (1.077) overload factor in military work centers and work centers with 1 to 6 civilian positions. 
2.7.2.1.2.  Use a 4.0 percent (1.04) overload factor for the extended overseas 48-hour workweek. 
2.7.2.1.3.  Use a 1.2 percent (1.012 overload factor for the wartime sustained and wartime contingency 60-hour workweek. 
2.7.2.1.4.  Do not apply overload factors against wartime surge, firefighter, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) faculty, or FN civilian workweeks. 
2.7.3.  The rounding rules for converting man-hours to manpower in the application of manpower standards are stated below and are depicted in the example at Attachment 4. 
2.7.3.1.  For United States Direct Hire (USDH) civilians, in work centers with 1 to 6 civilian positions, apply the OLF and round fractional manpower up to the next whole number. 
2.7.3.2.  For military and FN civilians, round manpower results to two decimal places and then round any fractional manpower up to the next whole number. 
2.8.  Manpower Standard Application Procedures.  AFPC/MA will notify the appropriate HAF functional and manpower addressees in each command when a new manpower standard is approved/posted (initial application); manpower standards are available for download from the MA SharePoint site: https://afma.eis.af.mil/mas/Manpower%20Standards/Forms/AllItems.aspx. 
2.8.1.  Unless otherwise directed by AF/A1M, MAJCOM manpower offices/staffs will apply and implement new active component manpower standards (initial application) and update MPES within 90 days of AFMS posting on the AFPC/MA SharePoint site and reapply manpower standards every two-years or earlier when significant workload or mission changes dictate.  During these reapplications, review the active component manpower standards for currency; apply and implement LCOM manpower studies, simulated and non-simulated portions, under these same criteria. 
2.8.2.  When implementing a manpower standard, follow the application procedures contained in the manpower standard, then use Attachment 4 to calculate detailed manpower requirements. 
2.8.3.  Manpower standard application and implementation includes applying the manpower standard with the most current available WLF data, per the applicable manpower standard’s direction,  and making the resultant changes to requirements in MPES. 
2.8.3.1.  Update the manpower requirements coding with the correct Manpower Standards Implementation (MSI) code.  There are multiple MSI codes to identify how a requirement was determined. 
2.8.3.2.  Update MPES using the FAC associated with the manpower standard. 
2.8.3.3.  Update authorized grades, using MAJCOM and Career Progression Group (CPG) grade factors for necessary adjustments.  (Chapter 4 contains a more inclusive discussion of grades). 
2.8.3.4.  Update other MPES data codes/attributes as required—paying particular attention to correctly updating the Grade, Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC), Special Access Requirements (SAR) and Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) codes. 
2.8.4.  Unless otherwise directed by AF/A1M, MAJCOM manpower staffs will: 
2.8.4.1.  Reallocate available manpower resources among their installations IAW the application results of the manpower standard in coordination with the respective MAJCOM functional representative or as directed by the MAJCOM commander. 
2.8.4.2.  Implement Air Force policy for MPES time-phasing as follows: 
2.8.4.2.1.  When implementation results equate to an increase or decrease in funded manpower authorizations, the MPES action requires an effective date of current quarter plus two fiscal quarters (FQ) as of the first day of the following month of the manpower authorization change/action.  The personnel system projects a personnel action the following month with 6 to 9 months lead time.  For example, if a manpower action is input to MPES during December (FYXXQ1), the effective date can be no earlier than 1 July (FYXXQ4) in order for the personnel system to generate a corresponding personnel actions; the effective date is particularly important if a change results in a PCS action. 
2.8.4.2.2.  When implementation results equate to an increase or decrease of unfunded manpower requirements, the MPES action will be updated to reflect the action effective immediately. 
2.8.5.  When implementation results exceed the current number of funded authorizations, each command will either (1) establish unfunded manpower requirements or (2) realign funded authorizations from within the command.  Unfunded requirements will be updated in MPES, and must be reviewed every two-years to ensure the unfunded requirements remain valid. 
2.8.6.  If the Air Force functional authority (typically the HAF 2-letter) gains approval from the Air Force Corporate Structure to cross-level manpower resources, AF/A1M will notify MAJCOM manpower staffs to apply and report the results to AF/A1M, but withhold implementation of the new manpower standard until further guidance is received.  AF/A1M will process a normal inter-command transfer action in the next programming cycle.  The AF/A1M Programming (AF/A1MP) staff will work with each command for specific situations. 
2.9.  Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Manpower - Determining FMS Resource Requirements. 
2.9.1.  The Arms Export Control Act, 22 USC 2751 (and following sections relating to the section, consistent with the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended) authorizes the sale of defense articles and services.  The DoD Appropriation and Authorization Acts include in the USAF statutory end strength ceiling, manpower resources to support FMS.  Although most FMS manpower is reimbursable, the Air Force programs the requirements to ensure 
coverage in the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).  The HAF does not retain a “pool” of manpower authorizations available for new FMS programs. 
2.9.2.  Preparing a Manpower Requirements Package (MRP). 
2.9.2.1.  MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs prepare a Manpower Requirements Package to justify support for an FMS case (see AFMAN 16-101, Chapter 4,  para 4.6).  Use AFMSs whenever possible; however if no AFMS applies, use alternative Air Force approved methods to determine requirements. 
2.9.3.  Manpower Classification. 
2.9.3.1.  FMS manpower authorizations are categorized as either:  full-time or part-time; those positions performing less than 10% FMS work are not considered FMS. 
2.9.4.  Use the following information to determine classification of required FMS positions: 
2.9.4.1.  Full-time positions perform FMS duties 90% or more of the available time. 
2.9.4.2.  Part-time positions perform both FMS and USAF workload.  Part-time authorizations spend more than 10% (but less than 90%) of their available time supporting FMS. 
2.9.4.3.  Use overhires for approved requirements when appropriate (surge or short term workload).  FMS funding must be available. 
2.9.5.  MPES coding of FMS Manpower.  Code FMS positions under Table 2.1 as follows: 
2.9.5.1.  Use Program Element Code (PEC) A2002 for full-time manpower reimbursed by direct case funds. 
2.9.5.2.  Program the authorizations in the appropriate PEC for commands using part-time manpower authorizations to perform direct case workload. 
2.9.5.3.  Program manpower reimbursed by administrative surcharge funds in the appropriate major force program using a shred of "S."  Note:  Only civilian and contractor positions (to include Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) contractors) can be reimbursed with Administrative Surcharge funds.  Military positions in an FMS admin surcharge PEC are Air Force funded).

Chapter 3 
USE OF MILITARY MANPOWER 
3.1.  Overview.  This chapter details the types of manpower used to accomplish Air Force missions and provides the tools for determining the appropriate mix of manpower and private sector support necessary to accomplish Air Force missions consistent with applicable laws and policies; also known as Workforce Mix (WFM). DoD Instruction (DoDI) 1100.22, Policy and Procedures for Determining Workforce Mix, provides additional guidance and procedures for determining the manpower mix of each function. The table in Enclosure 3, para 1.a. of DoDI 1100.22 contains a decision matrix for determining the mix of a workforce to the function level. Attachment 5 contains a decision matrix for determining the manpower mix to the skill of the position. 
3.2.  Types of Manpower.  The Air Force uses three types of manpower to perform required work: military personnel (active duty, Air Force Reserve, individual mobilization augmentee (IMAs), and National Guard), in-service civilian employees, and contracted services. 
3.3.  Use of Military Personnel.  In accordance with DoD guidance, the Services assign military personnel only to positions that: 
3.3.1.  Directly contribute to the prosecution of war (combat, combat support or combat service support). 
3.3.2.  Are military by law. 
3.3.3.  Are military by custom or tradition. 
3.3.4.  Are needed for overseas rotation, operational deployment augmentation, and/or career field sustainment. 
3.3.5.  See Attachment 5 for additional determination. 
3.4.  Use of Non-military Personnel.  For combat support or combat service support, use in-service civilian employees or contract services.  See Attachment 5 for additional determination. 
3.5.  Roles and Responsibilities. 
3.5.1.  AF/A1M is the OPR for policy defining military essentiality and ensuring MAJCOMs follow DoD policies and procedures when identifying manpower positions as military essential. 
3.5.1.1.  AF/A1M works closely with SAF/AQ to support the review of the Inventory of Contract Services (ICS) as required by Title 10 USC Section 2330a that is directly associated with Contract Full Time Equivalent (CFTE) information collection. 
3.5.1.2.  AF/A1M is the OPR to oversee that CFTE information provided from the Enterprise-wide Contracting Manpower Reporting Application (e-CMRA), also required by 10 USC Section 2330a, that is entered into MPES to supplement Workforce Mix determinations. 
3.5.2.  MAJCOM manpower staffs. 
3.5.2.1.  Follow DoD and Air Force directives on military essentiality. Create new military manpower positions only if the positions satisfy military-essentiality criteria.  Use Attachment 5 to guide the decision process. 
3.5.2.2.  Maintain number of authorizations by grade at or below their command grade levels using their grade allocation factors levied by the Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff, Manpower, Personnel and Services (AF/A1). The CPG factors can be used as a guide to maintain grade levels within their command. 
3.5.3.  Installation (servicing) Manpower Office: 
3.5.3.1.  Follows policies and procedures regarding military essentiality to establish new manpower positions, implement major mission or duty changes, or consider conversion of current positions. (T-1).  Use Attachment 5 in the decision process.  Determine military essentiality on the basis of the requirements of the position, or the need to maintain a specific capability rather than the characteristics of the incumbent.  (T-1). 
3.5.3.2.  Codes each manpower position in MPES for military essentiality, using the Inherently Governmental/Commercial Activity (IGCA) data field.  (T-1). 
3.5.3.3.  Coordinates all actions involving civilian manpower authorizations with the local servicing civilian personnel office.  (T-1). 
3.6.  Manpower Mix.  Military essentiality is the initial consideration to determine the correct manpower mix. 
3.6.1.  Military Essential Work.  When current authorized civilian positions are identified as military essential, commands will convert the civilian authorization to military through attrition unless mission requirements dictate a faster conversion.  Coordinate any conversion in functions that impact ANG forces training with the National Guard Bureau; coordinate Air Force Reserve conversions with AFRC. 
3.6.2.  Nonmilitary Essential Work. Use in-service civilian employees or contract services to perform work not requiring military personnel. Note: In work centers where civilian authorizations have been abolished as a result of a civilian reduction in force, MAJCOMs may not reassign permanent or overage military personnel to perform the tasks formerly accomplished by reduction-in-forced in-service civilian employees.  Functional managers may maintain the workload with the work center’s residual military including IMAs as specified in Chapter 9 or by realigning other civilian positions. 
3.6.3.  Manpower Mix Decision Process.  See Attachment 5. 
Chapter 4 
MILITARY GRADES 
4.1.  Overview.  This chapter provides an overview of the military grade allocation process with regards to ‘funded’ authorizations. Authorized (funded) military grades are established and allocated to commands within congressionally mandated ceilings IAW Air Force policy. With the exception of colonels and chief master sergeants, whose grades are allocated through a board process, the Air Force allocates grades via a programming model utilizing funded authorization ‘required grades’ to determine a fair share grades distribution by command and AFS/CPG.  This chapter does not apply to general officers or the Air Reserve Component (ARC). 
4.2.  The Military Grade Allocation Process. 
4.2.1.  As stated, military grades are established and allocated to commands in order to remain within congressionally mandated grade ceilings IAW Air Force policy.  Grades must remain in balance with the funding accounts identified within the annual DoD Authorization Bill. 
4.2.2.  Congressional ceilings constrain the number of active duty general officers, field grade officers and noncommissioned officers in the grades of chief master sergeant and senior master sergeant.  The DoD Authorization Bill defines the maximum number of officers and enlisted authorizations. 
4.3.  Grade Parameters and Allocations. 
4.3.1.  Military positions required to perform Air Force missions are identified by grade and skill using the manpower requirements determination process.  The Air Force considers enlisted skill level, rather than grade, the primary indicator with regard to experience and/or effectiveness required to perform a task; therefore the accuracy of stated grade and skill level requirements must be maintained when implementing enlisted grade adjustments. 
4.3.2.  The Air Force documents all funded and unfunded manpower requirements in MPES. Funded requirements contain required and authorized grades; the required grade data field in MPES reflects unconstrained grades/positions to accomplish a specific workload (constrained only by application of manpower standards or other manpower determinant).  The authorized grades data field reflects fiscal reality and defines those grades allowed by applying allocated grade factors to authorized end strength. 
4.3.3.  Statutory ceilings constrain the number of field grade officers (colonels, lieutenant colonels and majors) and senior enlisted non-commissioned officers (chief master sergeants and senior master sergeants).  Colonel and chief master sergeant review boards are established to review, validate, and recommend those positions to be funded at the grade of colonel or chief master sergeant.  Parameters for the remaining lower officer and enlisted grades are established through the grades allocation process which applies to lieutenant through lieutenant colonel and airman first class through senior master sergeant grades. 
4.3.4.  In summary, Air Force military grade management is an integral process comprised of colonel and chief master sergeant grade reviews and officer and enlisted grade allocations.  Although each is a separate event, they are designed to occur in sequence to ensure top down allocation and grade determination (i.e., colonels followed by officer allocations and chief 
master sergeant followed by enlisted allocations).  The table below represents the board and allocation sequence.

4.4.10.1.  Participate in prioritizing/ranking colonel and chief master sergeant requirements. 
4.4.10.2.  Coordinate on colonel and chief master sergeant military position descriptions. 
4.5.  Colonel Position Management. 
4.5.1.  Colonel grades are a critical resource managed within the statutory ceiling set forth by Title 10 United States Code, Subtitle A, Chapter 32, Section 523 (referred to as DOPMA).  DOPMA applies to all active duty officers in Resource Identification Code (RIC) 0004, except for the following: 
4.5.1.1.  Medical Corps and Dental Corps positions, (AFSCs: 44xx, Physician; 45xx, Surgery; 47xx, Dental; 40C0C, Medical Commander; 40C0D, Dental Commander and 48xx, Aerospace Medicine). 
4.5.1.2.  United States Air Force Academy permanent professors. 
4.5.2.  Another special category of colonel positions are Air Force Directed Colonel Grades.  A directed colonel grade is a command leadership position or unique staff-level position requiring military officer leadership in a minimum grade of colonel due to the level of responsibility inherent with the position. Directed colonel grades do not require review by the Colonel Grade Review (CGR) Board.  The Directed Requirements are as follows: 
4.5.2.1.  Executive Officer for the Secretary of the Air Force and Executive Officer for the Under Secretary of the Air Force. 
4.5.2.2.  Executive Officer for the Air Force Chief of Staff and Executive Officer for the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff. 
4.5.2.3.  Wing Commander, Wing Vice-Commander, or Group Commander position identified in the Manpower Programming and Execution System (MPES) with a organizational type code of “WG” or “GP”. 
4.5.2.4.  Any funded colonel position approved by CSAF to meet the Command Screening Board, per AF/DPO (Colonels Group). 
4.5.2.5.  Staff Judge Advocate positions in units/organizations where the Commander has General Courts Martial convening authority. 
4.5.3.  Colonel positions residing in activities outside of the Department of the Air Force. 
4.5.3.1.  No command or Air Force functional prioritization is required unless the CSAF directs their review. 
4.5.3.2.  The CGR Board will review these positions as an entire entity versus individual positions unless otherwise directed by the CSAF. 
4.5.3.3.  The CGR will provide an assessment and recommendation of the total number of colonel grades the Air Force may source to the outside activities taking into account the number of permanent, rotational, and nominative colonel requirements established by the Joint Manpower Validation Process. 
4.5.3.4.  CSAF will make the final determination as to the number of colonel grades allocated to the activities outside of the Department of the Air Force. 
4.5.4.  DOPMA colonel positions are managed through a colonel review process consisting of six processes beginning with the updating of colonel requirements in MPES; providing duty and mission descriptions for each colonel position; command/HAF CFM prioritization; board preparation; convening of an Air Force Board; and AF/A1 approval and implementation of the Board results. 
4.5.4.1.  Updating colonel requirements in MPES.  AF/A1 will notify commands to begin updating MPES with their colonel requirements by updating the Required Grade (RQRD GRD) in MPES. Command A1Ms are responsible for validating all colonel requirements using sound manpower principles.  Notify AFPC/MAMF of any pending or forecasted organizational changes, either activations or inactivations impacting colonel positions not reflected in MPES. HAF CFMs will work with their MAJCOM counterparts to advocate their position on where colonel requirements are needed. Unless mission dictates there will be no additional MPES updates impacting colonel positions (funded/unfunded) once commands have updated MPES with their colonel requirements and AFPC/MA has pulled those requirements from MPES to begin collecting duty descriptions.  Any changes must first be approved by AF/A1MR. 
4.5.4.2.  AFPC/MAMF will provide each command a data collection sheet containing all their colonel requirements identified in MPES.  Commands will update the data collection sheet with the duty description, mission description, and rater information for each colonel position.  Duty and mission descriptions will be written in very concise statements. Board members have limited time to read this information. 
4.5.4.3.  Commands and HAF CFMs will prioritize all non-directed colonel positions.  Each position will be given a unique prioritization value starting at “1” indicating the highest priority colonel position incrementally down to the lowest priority position known as “1-n”.  There cannot be any duplicate prioritization values.  The HAF CFM will prioritize by the three-digit Air Force Specialty (AFS).  The CFM is limited to prioritizing the colonel requirements defined and submitted by the commands.  That is why it is imperative for the CFM to be involved with their command counterparts at the beginning of the process when the commands are defining their colonel requirements.  It is recommended, at the very least, that the positions prioritized in the top and bottom ten percent have rationale included of why it was prioritized as such.  This aids the board members if/when major prioritization differences exist between the command and HAF CFM prioritization values. 
4.5.4.4.  Board preparation.  AFPC/MAMF prepares the data meeting the board working in conjunction with AF/A1MR and AF/DPO.  AF/DPO is responsible for board member selection, which is close-hold. The composition may vary but will have a mix of MAJCOM and HAF functional representation. 
4.5.4.5.  The Air Force Colonel Review Board is responsible for establishing an overall order-of-merit of all colonel requirements submitted by the commands.  The board takes into account the command/HAF CFM prioritizations, CSAF vision, and any other applicable information provided to the board members.  The board will recommend to the 
CSAF those positions which, in the Boards opinion, warrant colonel grade funding based on the number of colonel grades Title 10 supports for the projected officer end strength. 
4.5.4.6.  AF/DPO, along with the AF/A1M staff, forward the board results up to the CSAF.  The AF/A1 will notify the command A1s the final results have been determined, followed by AFPC/MAMF release of detailed results and instructions to the command A1Ms.  Once the final grade results are implemented by the Commands, no further MPES changes can be made to an authorized colonel position for two full fiscal quarters (6-months) from the date of the AF/A1 Implementation Memo. 
4.5.5.  Until the next CGR, commands will retain and utilize the colonel grades allocated by the CGR process as mission dictates, adhering to the following procedure below, except for one condition:  Colonel grades associated with mission/unit loses will be transferred to HAF if the command also loses the FYDP to HAF, or transfers FYDP to another command (inter-command transfer).  Additionally, new colonel grades may be allocated to the command when gaining new mission(s) and/or FYDP. 
4.5.6.  Post Board of colonel grade change procedures.  Following the implementation period, any changes to the approved AF colonel grade results will be handled as “out-of-cycle” requests. Procedures differ depending upon the category(s) of colonel grade involved.  Most changes will involve the non-directed category but rarely may involve the Directed Colonel grade category. 
4.5.6.1.  Approval authority to realign a 'non-directed' colonel grade as an offset to another directed or non-directed colonel grade requirement, or a directed colonel grade as an offset to another directed colonel grade requirement, rests with the MAJCOM/CC or equivalent.  Command A1Ms will ensure the action, to include AFS changes, is coordinated with the affected MAJCOM functional area manager(s).  An informational copy of the full transaction (the Authorization Change Request and new colonel Position Description (AF FM 81A)) will be provided to AF/A1MR, AF/DPO & AFPC/MAMF.  If the MAJCOM/CC or equivalent wishes to pursue the change with no offset, the MAJCOM will forward the package to include the request, justification, and rationale to AF/A1M who will staff and coordinate with the HQ functional area manager and AF/DPO prior to forwarding the package to the appropriate approval authority. 
4.5.6.2.  Approval authority to realign a directed colonel grade as an offset to a non-directed colonel grade requirement rests with AF/A1M.  If the MAJCOM/CC or equivalent wants to pursue such a change, the MAJCOM forwards the AF Form 81A, and a memo to include justification and rationale, to AF/A1M who will staff the package for approval.  Note:  adherence to the provisions of paragraph 4.4.9.2. is required. 
4.5.6.3.  Commands will make all colonel grade changes (in MPES) effective no earlier than current quarter, plus two quarters, from the date updated in MPES to allow for personnel lead-time actions unless otherwise directed by AF/A1M. 
4.5.6.4.  As a guiding principal, because colonel grades are a critical and scarce resource, the application of a colonel grade, serving in the capacity as Deputy, or the occasion of a colonel grade residing in the same work center (OSC) as a civilian General Schedule (GS) 15, should be rare and limited to the absolute extent possible only when/where mission requirements dictate. 
4.6.  Chief Master Sergeant Position Management. 
4.6.1.  Chief master sergeant grades are a critical resource managed within the congressional ceiling set forth by Title 10 United States Code, Subtitle A, Chapter 31, Section 517.  All active duty chief master sergeant positions in RIC 0104 are covered by Title 10 and managed by the chief master sergeant grade review process.  The Chief Review process follows the same procedures as the Colonel Review up until the boarding process; refer to paragraphs 4.5.4.1 through 4.5.4.4  AF/DPE replaces the roles of AF/DPO within those paragraphs.  Command chief master sergeants and group superintendent positions are boarded separately from the other chief master sergeant positions as explained below. 
4.6.1.1.  Command chief master sergeant and group superintendent boarding process.  Command chief master sergeant and group superintendent positions do not require prioritization due to these positions being determined by specific criteria approved by the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force (CMSAF).  A board consisting of the CMSAF, AF/A1, and AF/DPE validates these positions and makes final approval using the intent of AFI 36-2109, Chief master sergeant of the Air Force and Command Chief master sergeant Programs and any additional criteria approved by the CMSAF. 
4.6.1.2.  For all other chief master sergeant positions, the Air Force Chief Review Board is responsible for creating an overall order-of-merit of all chief master sergeant positions submitted by the commands.  The board takes into account the command/HAF CFM prioritizations, CMSAF vision, and any other applicable information provided to the board members.  The board’s recommendation to the AF/A1 of which positions to be funded to a chief master sergeant is based on the number of chief master sergeant grades Title 10 supports for the projected enlisted end strength. 
4.6.2.  A directed chief master sergeant grade is a position (manpower requirement) that warrants the grade of chief master sergeant due to the level of responsibility inherent with the position.  The approved directed grade list contains certain chief master sergeant positions which are considered to be directed, or institutional, grade requirements which do not require board review. 
4.6.2.1.  HAF:  Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, Chief of the Air Force Chief Master Sergeant Management Office, Chief of Enlisted Promotions and Evaluations and Chief of Airmen Assignments. 
4.6.2.2.  MAJCOM:  Chief of Enlisted Promotion and Evaluation, Commandant Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy. 
4.6.2.3.  Chief Master Sergeant Grade Review Implementation.  No changes will be made to funded chief master-sergeant positions in MPES for 180 calendar days following receipt of the HAF message implementing the CMSgt grade results. 
4.6.3.  Chief Master Sergeant Grade Change Procedures. 
4.6.3.1.  Approval authority to realign a 'non-directed' chief master sergeant grade as an offset to another directed or non-directed chief master sergeant grade requirement, or a directed chief master sergeant grade as an offset to another directed chief master sergeant grade requirement rests with the MAJCOM/CC or equivalent.  Coordinate all AFS changes with the affected MAJCOM functional area manager(s).  An informational copy 
of the full transaction (the Authorization Change Request and new chief master sergeant Position Description (AF FM 81B)) will be provided to AF/A1MR and AF/DPE.  If the MAJCOM/CC or equivalent wishes to pursue the change with no offset, the MAJCOM will forward the package to include the request, justification, and rationale to AF/A1M who will staff and coordinate with the HQ functional area manager and AF/DPE prior to forwarding the package to the appropriate approval authority." 
4.6.3.2.  Approval authority to realign a directed chief master sergeant grade as an offset to a non-directed chief master sergeant grade requirement rests with AF/A1M.  If the MAJCOM/CC or equivalent wants to pursue such a change, the MAJCOM forwards the package to include the request, justification, and rationale to AF/A1M.  AF/A1M will staff the package for approval.  Note:  the provisions of Paragraph 4.4.9.2 must be adhered to. 
4.6.3.3.  Make all chief master sergeant grade changes effective no earlier than current plus two quarters from the date updated in MPES to allow lead time for personnel actions unless otherwise directed by AF/A1M. 
4.7.  Air Force Reserve Colonel and Chief Master Sergeant Management. 
4.7.1.  Colonel and chief master sergeant Air Force Reserve Traditional Reserve positions (TRs) are typically determined by UTC requirement.  Active Guard Reserve (AGR) colonel and chief master sergeant positions are determined by validating a position description created by the organization requesting the position.  Position descriptions are validated by AFRC/A1M for Reserve unit AGRs, and by AF/REX for Reserve AGR positions outside of Air Force Reserve (at the HAF, OSD, COCOMs, etc). 
4.7.2.  The total number of AGR colonel and chief master sergeant grades are controlled by statute as specified in Title 10 USC, Section 12012. 
4.8.  Officer and Enlisted Grade Allocation.  The grade allocation process is designed to meet three objectives, (1) ensure compliance with legislative and budgetary grade constraints, (2) provide a method to equitably distribute limited grades throughout the Air Force and, (3) provide grade targets to functional and personnel communities to more effectively manage limited personnel resources.  This method ensures grades are fairly allocated to commands across all Air Force specialties based on established FYDP and grade ceilings; further, it ensures the number of authorized grades reflected on unit manpower documents do not exceed allowable grade levels.  Command adjustments to ‘Required’ grades, during the command grade allocation process, shall be IAW approved manpower determinants or standards as applicable.  The following procedures are used to allocate active duty military grades on a biennial basis: 
4.8.1.  Air Force Grade Ceiling Determination. 
4.8.1.1.  Colonel, lieutenant colonel and major grades are managed within congressional ceiling constraints set forth by United States Code (USC) Title 10, Subtitle A, Chapter 32, Part II, Section 523.  Air Force policy identifies and computes captain and lieutenant grades with regard to remaining end strength. 
4.8.1.2.  Field grade officer ceilings are based on funded end strength, for the allocation years from the appropriate table in USC Title 10, Subtitle A, Chapter 32, Part II, Section 523.  Since there is no specific ceiling outlined in USC Title 10 for company grade 
officers, captain and lieutenant grade allocations approximate the projected personnel inventory for the allocation years. 
4.8.1.3.  Chief master sergeant and senior master sergeant grades are constrained, by law, to three percent of the total budgeted enlisted force end strength, of which no more than one percent may be allocated as chief master sergeant.  Air Force policy determines the remaining enlisted grade ceilings (by percentage) for the remaining end strength for the allocation years. 
4.8.2.  Exclude the following from the process: 
4.8.2.1.  Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve positions. 
4.8.2.2.  Active (statutory tour) Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve Positions. 
4.8.2.3.  Medical Corps and Dental Corps Positions (AFSC 44xx, Physician; 45xx, Surgery; 47xx, Dental; 40C0C, Medical Commander; 40C0D, Dental Commander and 48xx, Aerospace Medicine). 
4.8.2.4.  Subtract student, transient and personnel holdee (patients, prisoners and separatees) and trainee grades from Air Force grade ceilings.  AF/A1M withholds and does not allocate non-permanent party students (data provided by A1MP), transients and personnel holdees to the commands.  AFPC/MA provides historical data for withheld grades. 
4.8.3.  Exclude the following grades from the fair share process: 
4.8.3.1.  General Officer positions.  General officer grades are determined by a separate process. 
4.8.3.2.  Colonel positions and chief master sergeant grades are determined through separate processes. 
4.8.4.  Subtract fixed grades, approved and provided by AF/A1M, from the total grades available; these fixed grades are not part of the fair sharing piece of the grades allocation process, but are added back in after fair sharing is completed to determine the command grade and AFS factors (AFS factors will be referred to as CPG factors throughout the grades allocation process).  The following categories are fixed at the authorized grade in MPES: 
4.8.4.1.  Outside the Air Force positions are requirements coded as Air Force FAC 7XXX in MPES, excluding PEC 00091519X, 000A2002X, or 000A1009A.  These requirements are identified with activities the Air Force does not control but are jointly manned with sister services and/or by foreign governments, and the United States, to include HQ Combatant Commands and Joint HQs activities of other military departments and U.S. Government agencies outside DoD.  (Note:  in the above example X equals any value.) 
4.8.4.2.  Reimbursable positions are requirements coded as PEC 00091519X, 000A2002X, or 000A1009A.  These positions are assigned to U.S. Government agencies outside the DoD (for example, OSD support) or support the Foreign Military Sales program.  No dollars are generated through the Air Force programming process for reimbursable positions; reimbursable positions are reimbursed from the host agency but are chargeable to the Air Force FYDP and grade ceilings.  (Note:  again, in the above example X equals any value.) 
4.8.4.3.  Miscellaneous fixed positions are functions or units with unique mission requirements approved and identified by AF/A1MR, per letter, prior to each allocation process (e.g. Special Duty, Band, certain USAFA positions, SNCO Academy instructors, USAFA group and squadron commander and support commander positions, etc.). 
4.8.5.  A grades allocation module of MPES is used to compute and allocate grades fairly across commands and AFS (CPGs). 
4.8.6.  Grade Factor Allocation to the MAJCOMs.  AF/A1M approves and provides command grade and AFS factors derived from the sum of fixed and fair share grades for all officer and enlisted positions.  Grades are allocated as factors (or percentages) to be applied to each command’s FYDP.  Two types of factors are developed and distributed: 
4.8.6.1.  Command grade factors:  Command compliance with command grade factors is mandatory, factors are provided to allow for grade adjustments as command resources may fluctuate.  Commands must implement the command grade factors to determine the overall command grade allowances for each grade; these established grade allowances will prevent commands from exceeding their fair share distribution of grades. 
4.8.6.2.  AFS (CPG) grade factors:  Commands are accorded flexibility when implementing AFS grade factors.  These factors serve as a fair share guide for manpower and functional personnel; Commands may redistribute grades by AFS as needed to meet mission requirements, but must remain within the commands overall grade allowances per grade as determined by implementing the command grade factors. 
4.9.  Command Grades Allocation Implementation and Maintenance. 
4.9.1.  Commands are given two grade factors:  1) Command Grade Factors (mandatory) and 2) Command AFS (CPG) Factors (guideline). 
4.9.2.  For enlisted positions, determine mandatory command grade allowances for each grade by applying the mandatory command grade factors to the command’s FYDP as such: 
4.9.2.1.  Subtract UMD authorized chief master sergeant grades from the FYDP results in an “adjusted FYDP.” (Note:   recommend using a dated UMD snapshot that is easily replicated). 
4.9.2.2.  Multiply the “adjusted FYDP” by each individual grade “command grade factor” (Note:  all fixed grades are included in the FYDP); this will result in a “mandatory command grade allowances” for each grade. 
4.9.3.  Enlisted AFS/CPG grade allowances for each grade are determined by applying the AFS/CPG grade factor to the AFS/CPG “authorized grade” total as outlined below.  (Note:  authorized grade totals include all fixed grades; results are used only as a guide). 
4.9.3.1.  Subtract all chief master sergeant “authorized grades” from each AFS/CPG’s authorized grade total (Note:  recommend using dated UMD snapshot easily replicated). 
4.9.3.2.  Multiply “total authorized grades” for that AFS/CPG by each grade’s AFS/CPG factor within the AFS/CPG. 
4.9.3.3.  The result(s) will be the AFS/CPG grade allowance for each grade in that AFS/CPG (Note:   repeat for all remaining AFS/CPGs in the command). 
4.9.3.4.  Sum the results for all AFS/CPG grade allowances for each grade and compare the AFS/CPG grade allowances to mandatory command grade allowances as referenced in paragraph 4.9.2 
4.9.3.5.  The results of that comparison will show if a command is under or over allocated in any particular grade IAW the mandatory command grade allowances. 
4.9.3.6.  An over allocation in any grade dictates the command must take action to comply with mandatory command grade allowances. 
4.9.3.7.  Commands have the flexibility to redistribute grades among AFS/CPGs during this process but must remain in compliance with the mandatory command grade allowances.  (Note:  “fixed” or authorized grades, cannot be adjusted.) 
4.9.4.  For officer positions, determine mandatory command grade allowances for each grade by applying the mandatory command grade factors to the command’s FYDP as such: 
4.9.4.1.  Subtract authorized Generals, Colonels and Medical Corps/Dental Corps (MC/DC) grades from the FYDP command’s FYDP results in an “adjusted FYDP” (Note:  recommend using a historical (dated) UMD snapshot that can be replicated). 
4.9.4.2.  Multiply the “Adjusted FYDP” by each individual “command grade factor” (Note:  all fixed grades are included in the FYDP); the results are the “mandatory command grade allowances” for each grade. 
4.9.5.  Officer AFS/CPG grade allowances for each grade are determined by applying the AFS/CPG grade factor to the AFS/CPG “authorized grade” total as outlined below.  (Note:  authorized grade totals include all fixed grades; results are used only as a guide). 
4.9.5.1.  Subtract authorized general, colonel and MC/DC officer grades from the authorized grade total.  (Note:   recommend using a historical (dated) UMD snapshot that can be replicated.) 
4.9.5.2.  Multiply “total authorized grades” for that AFS/CPG by each grade’s AFS/CPG factor within the AFS/CPG. 
4.9.5.3.  The result(s) will be the AFS/CPG grade allowance for each grade in that AFS/CPG (Note:   repeat for all remaining AFS/CPGs in the command). 
4.9.5.4.  Sum the results for all AFS/CPG grade allowances for each grade and compare the AFS/CPG grade allowances to mandatory command grade allowances as referenced in paragraph 4.9.4. 
4.9.5.5.  The results of the comparison will show if a command is under or over allocated in any particular grade IAW the mandatory command grade allowances. 
4.9.5.6.  An over allocation in any grade dictates the command must take action to comply with mandatory command grade allowances. 
4.9.5.7.  Commands have the flexibility to redistribute grades among AFS/CPGs during this process but must remain in compliance with the mandatory command grade allowances.  (Note:  “fixed” or authorized grades, cannot be adjusted.) 
4.10.  Grade Terminology/Definitions. 
4.10.1.  Fixed Grades:  Fixed grade categories are grades funded at 100 percent to the UMD authorized grade.  These grades are subtracted from the grades baseline during the fair sharing process.  However, they are added back into the fair share grades and are included in the final command and CPG grade factor determination. 
4.10.2.  Student, Transient, Personnel Holdee and Trainee Account.  The STP holdee account is used by Air Force budget programmers to determine the number of authorizations to allocate for the total number of military personnel who are not available for duty and not authorized on the UMD.  STP category accounts include: 
4.10.2.1.  Trainees:  Enlisted trainees and officer accession students include those active duty enlisted and officer military personnel who have not completed initial entry training. 
4.10.2.2.  Students:  Military trainees in PCS status of 20 weeks or greater (excludes upgrade training and flying training). 
4.10.2.3.  Holdees:  Active duty military member dropped from assigned strength of a force structure unit and attached to a holding activity for medical, disciplinary, or pre-separation non-availability. 
4.10.2.4.  Patients:  Active duty military members reassigned to a medical facility when hospitalization has exceeded or is expected to exceed 90 days. 
4.10.2.5.  Prisoners:  Active duty military members convicted by civil or military court and sentenced to confinement for 30 days or more. 
4.10.2.6.  Transients:  Active duty military members who have left their unit when executing a PCS move.  This covers only the time for leave and travel. 
4.10.2.7.  Colonels and chief master sergeants that are in a STP status are included as part of the DOPMA ceiling.  Since this value fluctuates on a monthly basis, a value is used based off a factor developed over 36 months historic data. 
4.10.3.  Fenced:  Colonel and Chief master sergeant positions, identified by the AF/A1M, that will be exempt from the Colonel and Chief master sergeant Reviews. 
Chapter 5 
CIVILIAN POSITION MANAGEMENT 
5.1.  Overview.  The Air Force is committed to managing civilian manpower authorizations within Congressional and budgetary constraints while also balancing mission needs with economy and efficiency of operations.  The policy directives that govern appropriated civilian resource management, position management and classification are AFPD 36-5, Civilian Personnel Resource Management and AFPD 36-14, Position Management and Classification.  The primary controlling factors in managing civilian resources are the validation of the civilian manpower requirement (permanent and temporary) by the servicing manpower office, the availability of manpower authorizations, work years and financial resources. 
5.2.  Roles and Responsibilities. 
5.2.1.  Supervisors and/or commanders.  Submit temporary or term requests, and new or revised civilian position description documents, to the servicing manpower office for coordination using a locally-devised Authorization Change Request (ACR) or other transmittal document.  (T-1). 
5.2.1.1.  Once the proposed action is validated and approved, the MO will return the action to the originator who will attach it to the Request for Personnel Action (RPA) for transmittal to the servicing civilian personnel activity.  (T-1). 
5.2.1.2.  The servicing civilian personnel activity will then provide the MO office a copy of the approved/classified civilian position to ensure the grade is consistent with the duties described in the position description, as well as the location of the position within the unit and its responsibilities as contained in the position description. After the approved/classified position description is returned, an ACR will be accomplished to update the required grade.  (T-1). 
5.2.2.  Installation/Servicing Manpower Office. 
5.2.2.1.  Coordinates with the servicing civilian personnel activity on ACR and organizational change requests (OCR) impacting civilian positions.  (T-1). 
5.2.2.2.  Ensures all ACRs use ‘To Be Determined’ (TBD) for the  authorized and required grades (pay band), for the Civilian position description (CPD), and four zeros “0000” for the occupational series (OCC Code) for civilian positions that do not yet have a final classification determination.  (T-1).  Final classification determination is defined as the official classification of the position by the servicing civilian personnel activity.  (T-1).  For civilian positions receiving a final classification determination, an electronic PDF copy of the final classification determination shall be attached to the ACR to document the completed action.  (T-1). 
5.2.2.3.  With regard to the authorized civilian grades, occupational series, and civilian personnel documents (PD), these will be updated directly into MPES via the authoritative source, DCPDS.  (T-1).  The process for these three fields will occur on a weekly basis to reduce processing times and eliminate unnecessary errors in MPES.  (T-1). 
5.2.2.4.  Coordinates on all new or revised permanent (i.e., non-temporary, non-term) civilian position descriptions, (T-1); and validates that the proposed civilian positions are assigned against valid UMD positions.  (T-1).  The installation MO will also review to ensure the approved organizational structure is maintained.  (T-1). 
5.2.2.5.  Reviews civilian position description documents to ensure the duties are consistent with the work center requirement and validates that the duties described in the position description are consistent with the AFSC and skill level allowed by existing manpower standards or by the position supervisor when a manpower standard is not available.  (T-1).  The MO certifies the position description, or Core Doc, does not include duplicate duties nor duties/responsibilities of any other position, or workload contained in existing contracts, regardless the type or funding source.  (T-1).  Duty descriptions and codes in Air Force Officer Classification Directory (AFOCD) and Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD), found on the AFPC/MA website, are broad indicators of duties and responsibilities and serve as valuable references on the type experience and/or level of civilian skills required.  (T-1).  The above is critical to ensuring the integrity of the unit manpower document which is an installation manpower office responsibility.  (T-1) 
5.2.2.6.  Reviews the unit’s UMD, organizational charts and any other pertinent documentation to affirm the duties of the civilian position are consistent with the work described in the position description and that it is appropriate for the work center.  (T-1). An interview with the supervisor of the position, to ensure the duties are correct/valid, may be appropriate if there is some question as to the duties attributed to the position and the intended grade, or other unintended consequences such as impacting another position or adversely affecting the supervisor to subordinate ratio.  (T-1).  The Office of Personal Management’s (OPM) General Schedule Supervisory Guide (GSSG) states that supervisory work must constitute a major duty occupying at least 25 percent of the position's time.  Note: some other factors to take into consideration would be the amount of time spent supervising, the complexity of the work of the organization, the type and grade level of the employees supervised, how the employees perform their work, whether fully administrative and/or technical duties are performed, etc.  (T-1). 
5.2.2.6.1.  Reviews the action to ensure span of control and layering principals (complexity of mission, similarity to similar organizational units, level of supervision required by subordinate units, degree of coordination required among subordinates, physical distance between subordinates and supervisor and organization structure) are acceptable; i.e., that no duplication or layering of supervision will occur within the organization as a result of the action, (T-1); and that new or revised duties and responsibilities do not replicate existing supervisory positions.  (T-1).  Established supervisory positions include military or civilian personnel. 
5.2.2.6.2.  Identifies unnecessary deputy or assistant positions and/or duties; co-equal managerial positions or duplication of supervisory duties at any level are not permitted, whether performed by two or more military, civilian, or a combination of the two.  (T-1).  MAJCOM/A1Ms, or equivalent, will approve deputy and assistant positions only when determined to be essential for span of control; the military or civilian head of the organization is frequently absent due to official duties (and no other subordinate can serve in an acting capacity; or other valid mission necessity. 
5.2.2.7.  Reviews and validates the requirement for a civilian overhire.  (T-1).  Civilian overhires are typically characterized as a short-term, seasonal or cyclical, workload requirement of less than one year’s duration.  (T-1).  Term overhires may be engaged for non-permanent work up for a period up to 4-years for competitive service and up to 5-years for excepted service.  (T-1).  Work load that is projected to last more than 4 years for competitive service and more than 5-years for excepted service is considered to be permanent and a funded position must be obtained to support it.  (T-1).  It is recommended that Overhires not be retained for workload beyond 4-years for competitive service and beyond 5-years for excepted service (some exceptions are positions involving hazardous material and/or environmental cleanup, base closures, etc.)  (T-1). 
5.2.2.7.1.  Overhires will not be validated and/or approved to replace, or compensate for unfunded manpower requirements on the UMD for long periods of time.  (T-1).  In instances as this the installation MO will explore other options to include realigning a lower priority funded manpower authorization from elsewhere on the installation to permanently resolve the situation, or obtain MAJCOM permission to pursue a local additive to the manpower standard.  (T-1).  The MO must be careful to fully justify the proposed option/resolution to the Wing Commander, Group Commander, or other senior decision making official.  (T-1). 
5.2.2.7.2.  Overhires are subject to:  MO workload validation; funding validation by the servicing resource management authority and recruitment of positions approved by the servicing civilian personnel activity or other similar activity/authority.  (T-1). 
5.2.2.8.  The Installation MO Officer, or Chief, serves as an advisor to the Installation Civilian Employment Cost Management Committee (CECMC) or like board, to assist with manpower related resource issues/questions.  (T-1). 
5.2.2.9.  Submits project work file information to the MAJCOM, or builds project work files in MPES to update the occupational series (OCC code) and grade (pay band) upon receipt of the final classification determination from the servicing civilian personnel activity.  (T-1). 
5.2.3.  Servicing Civilian Personnel Activity. 
5.2.3.1.  Ensures requests for personnel action that change or establish position descriptions have first been routed through, and coordinated/validated by, the installation MO prior to taking any classification action; this is to ensure the RPA is consistent with the intent of the position(s) on the UMD.  (T-1). 
5.2.3.2.  Ensures over hire requests are first coordinated with the servicing MO per paragraph 5.2.2.4  (T-1). 
Chapter 6 
MANPOWER ESTIMATE REPORT (MER) REQUIREMENTS 
6.1.  Overview.  The MER, also known as a Manpower Estimate by OSD, satisfies the congressional requirement to submit major acquisition program manpower requirements to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF).  The SECDEF reviews the manpower requirements report prior to approving full-scale engineering development or production and deployment.  Attachment 8 is an example of the required format for the MER. 
6.2.  General Information. 
6.2.1.  MERs are required by Title 10 United States Code, Section 2434.  DoDI 5000.2, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System, directs the development/completion of a MER at several milestones including full operational deployment (FOD) of defense systems. 
6.2.2.  The MER is the source document for determining the manpower requirements portion of the “total costs of ownership” for acquisition systems required by DoDD 5000.1, The Defense Acquisition System, Section E1.4.  In addition, it is the only OSD-level acquisition document that addresses manpower affordability from a military and DoD civilian end strength perspective, as well as contractor FTE perspective and is the only required acquisition document that addresses skill shortages. 
6.2.3.  A MER is an authoritative source document for projected out-year military, civilian and contract support manpower required for the acquisition and/or upgrade of a weapon system, support and automated information systems; or the concurrent transfer of systems from the Active to Reserve Component and retirement of systems from the inventory.  They are used to develop strategic forecasts of the defense workforce and assist with strategic planning.  A MER will be developed for all manpower-intensive programs (e.g., programs with high personnel or critical skill requirements) regardless of acquisition category and consistent with the DoD component’s manpower policies. 
6.2.4.  Manpower authorities (may be at HAF or at MAJCOM-level)  assess whether the estimates are comprehensive and accurate; there are sufficient resources (i.e., military, civilian and contract services) to support the program; there will be adequately trained personnel to operate, maintain and support the system; congressional “controls” (floors and ceilings) and administrative restrictions on special programs (such as resources “fenced” for the National Intelligence Programs) have been observed; and lastly that manpower and personnel objectives and/or thresholds in the capabilities documents have been met. 
6.2.5.  The MER further outlines the official Air Force manpower position and addresses whether the system is affordable from a military end strength, DoD civilian end strength and contractor FTE stand-point.  In addition, the manpower assessment ensures that MERs are based on the level of performance most likely to be achieved and recommends post-fielding verification of high-risk factors used for the estimate.  At later milestone decisions, the MER reflects results of developmental tests, as available. 
6.2.6.  The MER also summarizes key personnel decisions or assumptions that have a significant effect on manpower (e.g., plans for developing new, or restructuring existing career fields).  It addresses whether there are any hard-to-fill occupations, personnel 
inventory shortfalls, or other personnel concerns that could adversely impact full operational deployment or sustainment of the system.  When appropriate, the MER summarizes the knowledge, skills and abilities required by the operators, maintainers, trainers and support personnel and discusses any significant differences or shortfalls from the current and projected inventory. 
6.2.7.  The manpower authority for the lead DoD component for joint programs is responsible for obtaining approval of the MER from all DoD component manpower authorities participating in the program. 
6.2.8.  A draft MER should be approved for release at least 3 to 6 months in advance of the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) milestone review so that the manpower can be used for development of cost estimates and affordability assessments.  The final MER is submitted to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness ) [OUSD(P&R)] in sufficient time to support the Overarching Integrated Product Team (OIPT) review in preparation for the DAB.  Normally, the MER is sent 3 weeks prior to the OIPT review. 
6.2.9.  The content of the MER is approved by the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for  Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR) or designee and tailored to fit the program under review.  For example, manpower for system-specific training is generally included in the estimate, while manpower for basic training is usually excluded.  A MER is required at Milestones B, C and full-rate production.  It will be updated at each of these milestones consistent with changes in other program documentation.  Where possible, the estimate will reference rather than duplicate information in other acquisition program documentation. 
6.3.  Manpower Estimating Considerations. 
6.3.1.  Estimating Methodologies. 
6.3.1.1.  The MER briefly describes methodologies used to estimate the manpower for each type unit and organization and states whether the Air Force manpower authority, or designee, has validated the methodologies.  It identifies key factors and assumptions used to estimate the manpower (e.g., maintenance ratios, equipment usage rates, crew ratios, aircrew instructor positions, course development and fielding schedule) and states whether they were provided by the program manager, based on comparable contemporary systems, or reflect test results. 
6.3.1.2.  Reengineering initiatives and studies, approved plans for base closures, restructuring initiatives, OMB Circular A-76 competitions, in-sourcings, direct conversions, or other initiatives that significantly affect the quantity or workforce mix of military and civilian manpower and contract support must be addressed. 
6.3.1.3.  The source of support for all new and modified systems, regardless of acquisition category, is based on the Manpower Mix Criteria and Guidance for Risk Assessments.  Risk mitigation takes precedence over cost savings in high-risk situations or when there are intelligence or security concerns. 
6.3.2.  Affordability.  System affordability represents the degree to which the life-cycle cost of an acquisition program is consistent with the long-range investment and force structure plans of the Department and addresses the following points: 
6.3.2.1.  New, Displaced and Replaced Equipment.  If systems are retired from the inventory or move from active to the ARC to support fielding of the new system, the MER must identify the replaced systems, affected units or platforms and the replacement rates (e.g., two-for-one replacement), by fiscal year. 
6.3.2.2.  Manpower Requirements and Contract Support.  The MER must compare manpower requirements for the new system with those required for the replaced systems (i.e., systems retired or transferred) and describe increases or decreases in military or DoD civilian end strength and contractor civilian manpower requirements.  Increases or reductions in CFTEs must also be reported.  The cause for increases or decreases (e.g., equipment replacement rates; reduced force structure; reduced levels of maintenance; changes in operating tempos, maintenance ratios, crew ratios; or training throughput course changes) must be reported if significant to the program.  If manpower for the new system is significantly higher or lower than what was required by the replaced system, manpower officials will also assess whether manpower providing indirect support, such as base operating support (BOS) and operational medical and mess, will increase or decrease and report any significant changes.  (T-1). 
6.3.2.3.  Manpower Authorizations.  The estimate must address resource shortfalls and state whether any increases in military or civilian authorizations, beyond what is included in the FYDP, or waivers to existing manpower constraints, will be required to achieve the resource levels reported in the estimate.  Major resource shortfalls are identified as risks in the MER and reported to the program manager for inclusion in the acquisition strategy. 
6.3.2.4.  Staffing.  In addition to reporting the manpower requirements and authorizations, assurances are needed that skilled personnel required to operate, maintain, train and support the system will be available upon fielding.  Manpower might be required and authorized but the positions are not filled due to career field manning recruitment, retention, training, or other personnel issues; this can seriously impact the future success of the acquisition.  The MER addresses whether there are any hard-to-fill positions, personnel shortfalls, or other issues that could adversely affect fielding.  Major personnel shortfalls must be identified as risks in the MER and acquisition strategy. 
6.3.3.  Risk Assessment.  At full-rate production, manpower authorities will recommend post-fielding verification of high-risk factors. 
6.3.3.1.  The MER clearly states whether the manpower requirements reported in the estimate are subject to change. 
6.3.3.1.1.  The MER states whether any of the factors or assumptions used to estimate the manpower are significantly different from what is used to determine manpower requirements for comparable contemporary systems and whether the differences are significant enough to represent a risk to the validity of the manpower estimate.  When significant manpower reductions or changes in skill sets are expected as a result of technology insertion and/or doctrine and policy changes, the MER addresses the risk of achieving these reductions or changes commensurate with the developmental and programmatic risk of the technology and/or doctrine and policy changes.  Estimates for systems under spiral or block development must indicate whether post-fielding verification of the manpower for the initial systems confirmed or invalidated the MER.  The estimate must also address whether the maintenance, support, or training 
concepts represent a significant enough departure from those of comparable contemporary systems to warrant post-fielding verification of the manpower. 
6.3.3.1.2.  The MER indicates whether approved restructuring initiatives (e.g., reorganizations, functional realignments, streamlining, or reengineering efforts) have been completed for OMB Circular A-76 competitions, personnel initiatives (e.g., consolidation of military or civilian career fields), or other actions that could affect the manpower or provide for more efficient and effective processes as required by DoDI 5000.2, Section 3.7.2.1. 
6.3.3.2.  When engineering designs increase individual workloads or task complexities, the impact on human performance and risk of cognitive or physical overload must be evaluated.  The MER identifies whether there is a risk that operators, maintainers, or support personnel may not have the skills or abilities to perform the required duties/mission. 
6.3.3.3.  Major manpower resource or personnel shortfalls must be identified as risks in the MER and acquisition strategy.  The MER also states whether the new system meets or exceeds manpower and personnel constraints (objectives and thresholds) in the Capability Development Document and key performance parameters in the Acquisition Program Baseline. 
6.4.  Manpower Estimate Report Preparation.  AF/A1MR prepares a Staff Summary Sheet (SSS) and a memo for AF/A1M signature.  The lead command prepares all remaining items. 
6.4.1.  Staff Summary Sheet.  AF/A1MR coordinates the MER throughout the HAF and Secretariat.  The staff summary sheet lists the commands responsible for developing the MER and gives a brief statement of requirements, offsets and shortfalls. 
6.4.2.  Cover memorandum from AF/A1M to OUSD (P&R).  This memorandum transmits the Air Force report to OSD for entry into the acquisition process. 
6.4.2.1.  This memorandum briefly identifies the program and milestone under review, resource shortfalls, personnel issues and the effect the program will have on the Air Force manpower structure.  It indicates whether increases in military or civilian manpower are above programmed levels or waivers to existing manpower constraints/restrictions are required to support the program. 
6.4.2.2.  The cover memorandum states program risks and whether manpower constraints (objectives and thresholds) and key performance parameters for manpower are met or exceeded. 
6.4.3.  The MER consists of the following elements: 
6.4.3.1.  The first paragraph cites the pending milestone decision and the legal mandate for the report.  If the Air Force is the lead service for a multi-service report, reference the location of the other service reports within the Air Force input.  The second paragraph summarizes the program, gives the FOD manpower requirements and states the timing and size of any manpower shortfalls.  Use a third paragraph, if needed, to describe the impact of any manpower shortfall on fielding the system. 
6.4.3.2.  Program Synopsis.  This provides decision makers a program summary that describes the system, shows deployment schedules and explains the operations, maintenance and training concepts for the system. 
6.4.3.3.  Manpower Requirements Methodology and Rationale.  This illustrates manpower requirements for operations, maintenance, support and training by component and/or command.  Identify each component’s and/or command’s requirement by category and the methodology used to estimate requirements as appropriate. 
6.4.3.4.  Component Requirements Detail.  For each component, prepare a separate display of the manpower required for the new system.  This shows basic functions used to build requirements, parallels information in paragraph 6.4.3.3 and projects the requirements by year from initial production to retirement of the weapon system.  This is generally for 20 years past FOD and a five-year retirement schedule. 
6.4.3.5.  Manpower Impacts by Component.  Required by OSD Personnel and Readiness (OSD P & R), this piece of the MER summarizes offsets and shortfalls, and will cover the same time period as paragraph 6.4.3.4 and provide the best available data.  If offsets and shortfalls are undefined or undecided, provide a paragraph listing the reasons why offsets/shortfalls are undefined and/or undecided and a projected date they will be available.  Group the data by components and divide each group into Requirements, Offsets and Shortfalls, broken out by Officers, Enlisted, Civilians and Contractors.  Lastly, provide a summary of the total Air Force requirements, offsets and shortfalls. 
6.4.3.6.  Statement of Manpower Requirements.  This covers all years beginning with initial fielding and ending with retirement and disposal of the system, to include environmental cleanup and includes five groupings (Operations, Maintenance, Support, Training and Total). 
6.4.3.7.  The Maintenance grouping includes organizational and intermediate maintenance.  Under Support Grouping include depot maintenance, central logistics support, program office, Air Force plant representative office, contract administrative support and associated BOS manpower for each element.  Under Operations Grouping include Aircrew Instructors and other operations student support (e.g., Standardization/Evaluation, Liaison, Life Support).  Under Training Grouping include course development requirements. 
6.4.3.8.  Each grouping will include a breakout reflecting active officer, active enlisted, civilian (U.S. and FN), Air Force Reserve and ANG technicians, drill officers, drill enlisted, AGR officer, AGR enlisted, contractors and the overall total.  If technician and/or contractor requirements are part of the program, include a man-year total, which is a total of all categories and a manpower total which excludes the contractors and technicians.  Any manpower shortfall will be identified/programmed as ‘organic’ resources when required skills are not available. 
6.4.4.  Periodic updates of the MER will follow same procedures.  AF/A1 and lead command will identify known changes to initial concepts when tasked. 
Chapter 7 
ACTIVE GUARD AND RESERVE REQUIREMENTS 
7.1.  Overview.  Commands establish AGR authorizations for members of the ANG or AFRC.  These authorizations are filled by personnel voluntarily serving on extended active duty or active duty (other than training) for a specified period of time, usually over 360 days.  Department of Defense Instruction 1205.18, Full-Time Support (FTS) to the Reserve Components, is the governing directive listing duties and responsibilities of FTS to the Reserve components. 
7.2.  Roles and Responsibilities. 
7.2.1.  Congress and OSD establish ceilings/limitations on management headquarters activities and Air Force personnel end strengths.  Programs utilizing AGR authorizations are subject to the usual budgetary review scrutiny just as any other Air Force program IAW Title 10 and Title 32 United States Code. 
7.2.2.  Command-established AGR authorizations. 
7.2.2.1.  Include duties that support the applicable section of Title 10 United States Code, Armed Forces, AFPD 36-21, Utilization and Classification of Air Force Military Personnel and AFI 36-2116, Extended Active Duty for Reserve Component Officers. 
7.2.2.2.  Include duties not routinely assigned to, or not the responsibility of, the active force. 
7.2.3.  The Director of the ANG (NGB/CF) and the Chief of the Air Force Reserve (AF/RE) validate all AGR authorizations not specifically established in law, ensure position currency and approve establishment/change to AGR positions (as delegated by Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Reserve Affairs (SAF/MRR)). 
7.2.4.  Title 10 United States Code, Sections 12011 and 12012 limit the grades for AGR field grade officer and senior enlisted authorizations. 
7.2.5.  Document all AGR authorizations in MPES with the appropriate RIC and functional category. 
7.3.  Procedures to Change or Request New Authorizations. 
7.3.1.  A single request may include more than one similar type position.  All requests must identify the total number of authorizations required and follow the instructions in Attachment 5 to determine the appropriate manpower work force mix.  AGR resources are extremely limited.  Requests for new authorizations will include potential sourcing options.  The requesting unit organizational commander, or chief, shall include a cover letter stating the overall intent of the position.  (T-1).  Follow the instructions in Attachment 6 for AGR position requests. 
7.3.2.  NGB/CF and AF/RE will review the requests for need, compliance, allocation use and impact on congressional, OSD and budget limits.  NGB/CF and AF/RE approve validated requests. 
7.3.3.  NGB/CF and AF/RE send copies of the validation, funding decision and supporting documentation to the requesting manpower activity. 
7.3.4.  HQ AFRC/A1M maintains AGR authorizations within approved end strength and grade ceilings for the AFRC AGR unit program.  AGR unit requirements and authorizations supporting Air Force approved programs do not need to be forwarded to AF/RE.

8.1.1.2.  Monitors the MPES manpower database to make sure the data complies with policies and procedures. 
8.1.2.  Gaining Command.  The Gaining command is responsible for: 
8.1.2.1.  Setting mobilization manpower requirements for gained units in coordination with the Joint Force Provider Component and IAW paragraph 8.2.2 
8.1.2.2.  Developing mobilization manpower requirements for ARC units and provides manpower requirements to HQ AFRC/A1M, or Headquarters National Guard Bureau Manpower, Organization and Resources Division (NGB/A1M). 
8.1.2.3.  Informing NGB or HQ AFRC of specified manpower requirement changes needed before making them in MPES.  Clearly explain the rationale for the change. 
8.1.2.4.  Forwarding  any unresolved disagreements to AF/A1M for resolution, and providing a summary of the differences and recommendations to NGB/A1M, AF/REX and HQ AFRC/A1M. 
8.1.3.  AFRC and ANG/A1M. 
8.1.3.1.  AFRC and ANG will ensure the appropriate gaining command is identified in MPES for all ARC manpower requirements. 
8.1.3.2.  Establish manpower requirements needed for in-place mobilization and for managing, supporting and training units in a non-mobilized status when the gaining command does not provide this support.  Incorporate these authorizations with the gaining command’s mobilization manpower requirements and send the consolidated data to HAF, the gaining MAJCOM, MA and the respective reserve units. 
8.1.3.3.  Monitor unit programming actions to ensure unit designations are valid and personnel accounting symbol (PAS) codes are available.  Confirm and communicate unit designation and PAS codes to gaining commands as soon as they complete programming actions.  (Note:  Only NGB may allocate manpower resources, to include skill level and grade and prepare manpower documents for ANG state headquarters according to approved Air Force staffing guides). 
8.1.3.4.  Validate authorizations needed for the non-mobilized environment. 
8.1.3.5.  Review ARC authorization skill and grade distribution to ensure they comply with current Air Force and DoD guidance (DoDD 1100.4) as outlined in this publication. 
8.2.  Establishing Manpower Requirements. 
8.2.1.  Criteria.  The Air Force bases manpower authorizations approved for ARC units on: 
8.2.1.1.  Established ARC manpower standards and guides, support agreements and programming documents. 
8.2.1.2.  Approved unit type codes (UTC). 
8.2.1.3.  Information and automated manpower file excerpts exchanged among gaining and host commands, the NGB, HQ AFRC, ANG and HAF. 
8.2.2.  Requirements for Gained Units.  Commands establish mobilization manpower requirements for gained ARC component units; these requirements state the manpower resources needed to augment the active forces in wartime and contingencies.  (Note:  Obtain NGB/A1M or HQ AFRC/A1M coordination before placing mobilization manpower requirements into MPES.  Use the required grade of the active force UMD and standards for like functions to determine ARC required grades.) 
8.2.3.  Requirements for full-time in-place and non-mobilized units.  The ANG and HQ AFRC will determine manpower requirements needed for in-place mobilization and for managing, supporting and training Guard and Reserve units in a non-mobilized status. 
8.2.3.1.  With justification for change, state whether the action was started by the gaining command or is a peacetime requirement authorized by this chapter. 
8.2.3.2.  ANG and/or HQ AFRC maintains the ACRs for their respective authorizations included in MPES. 
8.2.3.3.  Documents.  The USAF Program Guidance and USAF Programs, Installations, Units and Priorities documents provide the numbers and types of ARC units programmed by time period and unit location.  AF/A1M uses the Manpower Transaction Report to monitor manpower programs established for ANG and AFRC units. 
8.3.  Changes in Grade.  ANG or HQ AFRC may specify military grades that differ from those specified in the gaining command’s standard statement.  This flexibility enables them to respond to management problems inherent to the unit. 
8.3.1.  Retain all enlisted required grade changes within the required AFSC and skill level spread shown in the governing directive Manpower Force (MANFOR Packaging System) detail by the gaining command.  Further, do not change the authorized skill level more than one skill level from the required skill level unless the UTC allows.  For example if the required skill is a 3D071, you may substitute a 3D051 or 3D091. 
8.3.2.  Keep all officer required grade changes within the required AFSC and grade spread authorized in the governing directive (MANFOR Packaging System detail) for the gaining command required AFSC.  Further, do not change the authorized grades more than one grade level from the required grade unless the UTC allows more than one grade. 
8.3.3.  Restriction.  Commands may not use this grade realignment guidance to shift grades between gaining command wartime requirements and ARC additive requirements approved for in-place mobilization for managing, supporting and training units in a non-mobilized status unless baseline enlisted and officer grade requirements are adhered to.

9.5.5.  In conjunction with the functional OPR, brief the ANG Corporate Structure on the manpower standard impact application results and resource impact. 
9.6.  Unit Manpower Document Development and Maintenance. 
9.6.1.  Determining Full-time Manpower Requirements.  A1MR Responsibilities: 
9.6.1.1.  Develop and maintain a schedule for the bi-annual application of approved manpower standards to determine full-time manpower requirements.  Standard application schedule will be posted on the NGB/A1M page on the AF Portal. 
9.6.1.2.  Perform currency reviews in conjunction with bi-annual application of manpower standards. 
9.6.1.3.  NGB/A1MR will notify the affected Functional Area Manager (FAM) in writing one quarter prior to standard application and attach a copy of the latest manpower standard for their review. 
9.6.1.4.  The FAM will review the POD for currency to identify work no longer performed, or work processes that have changed since the standard was developed; additionally, the FAM must justify all proposed changes with regulatory (i.e., AFI) references and supporting documentation. 
9.6.1.5.  The FAM must review each workload factor definition and source of count and certify that they are still accurate.  If they are no longer valid, the FAM must provide a written explanation of changes. 
9.6.1.6.  If the FAM identifies significant changes since the standard was developed, NGB/A1MR will forward a copy of the FAMs concerns to NGB/A1MM.  The FAM, NGB/A1MM and NGB/A1MR will jointly determine whether the standard is still valid or requires update. 
9.6.2.  If a standard requires major revision and is no longer a valid method of determining accurate manpower requirements, NGB/A1MM will schedule the function for standards development or standards maintenance. 
9.6.2.1.  Apply most current approved manpower standards bi-annually using historical workload data from previous fiscal year. 
9.6.2.2.  NGB/A1MR will analyze the workload data for extremes, or trends, and resolve data anomalies with the functional OPR.  There may be approved program changes that will result in data that will be significantly different than historical workload data averages.  In these cases, it is more appropriate to use projected workload for determining manpower requirements or less than a full year of workload data.  For example, if a manpower standard uses flying hours to determine manpower requirements, and a unit is 
approved to add 2000 flying hours in the next few months, do not use the ‘historical’ average. 
9.6.2.3.  Notify the affected State, units, and affected FAM one fiscal quarter before a scheduled ANG MS application.  The notification will include all workload reporting requirements and any other information required to apply the ANGMS. 
9.6.2.4.  Obtain FAM coordination on the standard application results prior to implementation. 
9.6.2.5.  Coordinate all standard application results impacting resources with Chief, Program Development Branch (NGB/A1MP) before notifying the affected states or units of the results.  If a standard application reduces requirements, unfunded positions will be removed before funded.  If requirements increase, requirements will be added as unfunded until resources are identified.  Excess resources will be returned to the ANG Corporate Structure to be applied to ANG corporate priorities. 
9.6.2.6.  When implementation of an ANG Manpower Standard results in an increase or decrease in funded manpower authorizations, the MPES action requires an ‘effective date’ of current quarter plus two fiscal quarters (FQ) as of the first day of the following month of the manpower authorization change action. 
9.6.3.  Perform out-of-cycle reapplication of standards as determined by the Chief, Requirements Branch due to short notice mission changes, force structure changes, flying hour changes, significant shifts in population, etc. 
9.6.4.  Use the approved ANG Man-hour Availability Factor (MAF) plus the applicable overload factor, rounding up for standards application. 
9.6.5.  Ensure authorized military grades on full-time positions are compatible with AFSC and skill level requirements in the ANGMS when specified and Career Progression Group (CPGs) limitations. 
9.6.6.  Determine manpower requirements using alternative methods such as staffing patterns and post manning when no ANGMS is applicable. 
9.7.  Determining Military Manpower Requirements.  NGB/A1MR Responsibilities: 
9.7.1.  Review new Unit Type Codes (UTCs) and unit Designed Operational Capability (DOC) taskings during the initial development and staffing process to validate manpower requirements and determine ANG manpower impact. 
9.7.2.  Build UMDs IAW gaining MAJCOM (Major Command) approved UTCs and DOC taskings. 
9.7.2.1.  Changes must be projected on the UMD at least two fiscal quarters in advance. 
9.7.2.2.  Coordinate UMD changes with appropriate gaining MAJCOMs. 
9.7.2.3.  Create peacetime positions only when full-time requirements exceed UTC requirements or when an ANG approved mission or function is not UTC tasked. 
9.7.3.  Determine authorized military grades (GRD) by applying Career Progression Group limits and providing grade enhancement.  Due to grade enhancement, the minimum 
authorized grade on ANG UMDs is Staff Sergeant for enlisted and Major for officer positions.  Required grades (RGR) will reflect the UTC requirement. 
9.8.  NGB/A1MR will reconcile funded UMD to allocated manpower resources. 
9.8.1.  NGB/A1MP is responsible for manpower resources allocation per AFI 38-204. 
9.8.2.  NGB/A1MP is also responsible for control grades allocation. 
9.9.  Manpower Change Request (MCR) Process. 
9.9.1.  Requesting Unit Responsibilities. 
9.9.2.  The Commander or supervisor will submit MCRs to NGB/A1M in accordance with this Instruction.  (T-1).  Local offices should submit ANG Manpower Change Requests via e-mail to A1M_Actions. 
9.9.3.  The unit Wing Commander will sign the MCR.  (T-1). 
9.9.4.  Ensure all MCRs impacting full-time manpower positions include the respective State Human Resource Office (HRO) endorsement.  (T-1).

Chapter 10 
AIR NATIONAL GUARD ENLISTED GRADES PROGRAM/EXECUTION 
10.1.  Overview.  This chapter establishes policy for an enlisted grades program for all Air National Guard (ANG) military positions at the unit level and is applicable to all enlisted grades included in Unit Manpower Document (UMD) funded military end-strength numbers, except those organizations, AFS(s), Special Duty Identifiers or Reporting Identifiers identified in advance by the ANG Command Chief or Director, Air National Guard.  This guidance will be implemented by Career Field Functional Managers (CFFM)/Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) and the Air National Guard Manpower, Organization and Resources Division.  The ANG Enlisted Grades Program is designed to ensure that enlisted grades are equitably distributed throughout all ANG field level units. 
10.1.1.  Program Objectives.  The ANG Enlisted Grades Program is designed to meet the following objectives: 
10.1.1.1.  Ensure compliance with established grade percentages. 
10.1.1.2.  Provide a method/procedure to equitably distribute enlisted grades throughout all ANG field level units. 
10.1.1.3.  Provide Directorate Enlisted Grades Council representatives/Career Field Functional Managers (CFFMs) the authority to allocate grades in their Air Force Specialties (AFSs) they represent. 
10.2.  Enlisted Grades Council (EGC).  The EGC will convene and review the enlisted grade structure every two years.  The Director, Air National Guard (DANG) can direct an enlisted grade review at any time deemed necessary.  The major participants in the ANG Grades Program are: ANG Command Chief, CFFMs, EGC representatives, a representative from the ANG Manpower Office and the Enlisted Field Advisory Council (EFAC) representatives.  The responsibilities for each of these participants are as follows: 
10.2.1.  ANG Command Chief.  The ANG Command Chief is responsible for ensuring compliance with this Instruction and chairs the EGC and makes recommendations to the DANG. 
10.2.1.1.  CFFMs.  Regardless of the Program Element Code (PEC), responsible for coordinating AFS(s) with Functional Area Managers (FAMs) and ensuring the grades allocations and distribution process supports mission requirements and career progression within their AFS(s).  Conducts a review of the AFS/career fields and determines distribution while maintaining a zero within-grade balance of the total grades allocated for their AFS(s). 
10.2.1.2.  EGC Representatives.  A chief master sergeant representative is assigned by each A Staff and Special Staff Director as listed in paragraph 10.2.1.5  These representatives are responsible for the overall grades structure of all AFS(s) within their areas and represent the ANG corporate process on enlisted grades. 
10.2.1.3.  ANG Manpower, Organization and Resources Division.  Manpower administers the ANG Enlisted Grades Program and co-chairs the EGC.  This is 
accomplished by ensuring the program parameters and percentage constraints are established and in compliance. Manpower maintains and provides the ANG Enlisted Grades data.  Baseline data for this process is current end of fiscal year data from the manpower database.  Manpower will schedule the council meetings.  Manpower is also responsible for accurately reflecting and maintaining enlisted grades in the manpower data system. 
10.2.1.4.  Enlisted Field Advisory Council (EFAC).  The EFAC will provide three representatives for the EGC.  These members represent the voice of the field in the ANG corporate process on enlisted grades. 
10.2.1.5.  Air Force Specialty Responsibilities by NGB A Staff and Special Staff Directorate. 
10.2.1.5.1.  NGB/A1 - 3SX and 3M0. 
10.2.1.5.2.  NGB/A2 - 1NX, 1A8 and 9SX. 
10.2.1.5.3.  NGB/A3 - 1AX, 1CX, 1P0, 1SX, 1TX and 1WX. 
10.2.1.5.4.  NGB/A4 - 2XZ, 2FX, 2GX, 2MX, 2PX, 2RX, 2SX, 2TX, 2WX and 6CX. 
10.2.1.5.5.  NGB/A6 - 3DX. 
10.2.1.5.6.  NGB/A7 - 3EX and 3PX. 
10.2.1.5.7.  NGB/FM - 6FX. 
10.2.1.5.8.  NGB/SG - 4X. 
10.2.1.5.9.  NGB/CF - 3NX, 5JX, 5RX, 8FX, 8RX, 9EX, 9GX and HRAs. 
10.3.  Enlisted Grade Percentages and Allocation Process. 
10.3.1.  ANG Enlisted Grade Percentages.  The below percentages are the cornerstone of the ANG Enlisted Grades Program and are applicable to all ANG field level units.  They are defendable to Air Staff, and are not to be exceeded as they represent a percentage of total ANG funded enlisted end-strength: 
10.3.1.1.  CMSgt - 2%. 
10.3.1.2.  SMSgt - 5%. 
10.3.1.3.  MSgt - 18.5%. 
10.3.1.4.  TSgt - 25.5%. 
10.3.1.5.  SSgt - 49%. 
10.3.2.  These percentages are applicable to all enlisted grades included in funded military end-strength numbers, except organizations, AFS(s), Special Duty Identifiers or Reporting Identifiers identified in advance by the ANG Command Chief or Director, Air National Guard. 
10.4.  ANG Enlisted Grades Allocation Process. 
10.4.1.  The first foundational rule will be to apply the percentages established in paragraph 10.3.1 
10.4.2.  The second criteria will be to ensure no Unit Type Code (UTC) was broken after applying the percentages.  If a UTC is broken, review the UTC to ensure it is properly constructed.  If the UTC build is deemed to be correct with respect to resources, rework the AFS Grade allocations through EGC. 
10.4.3.  The final rule requires that all disconnects will be identified and brought to the attention of EGC for resolution. 
10.5.  Implementation.  CFFMs/EGCs will work with manpower to revise the Unit Manpower Document (UMD) to reflect the grade changes generated by the ANG Enlisted Grades Allocation Process. 
Chapter 11 
INDIVIDUAL MOBILIZATION AUGMENTEE REQUIREMENTS 
11.1.  Overview.  IMAs are individual members of the Selected Reserve or Participating Individual Ready Reserve assigned to an active component of the DoD or other U.S. Government agency in war, contingency operations and peacetime to meet national defense, strategic national interest and domestic objectives. 
11.2.  Roles and Responsibilities. 
11.2.1.  SAF/AAR and MAJCOM Manpower (A1M) Staff will: 
11.2.1.1.  Review, coordinate and validate requests, from using organizations, for new requirements, ensuring the requirement meets one of the criteria in paragraph 11.3  and does not violate the provisions in paragraph 11.5 
11.2.1.2.  Maintain documentation (AF FM 9, local form, etc.) for validated IMA requirements;  units shall maintain the documentation for as long as the position exists, or as long as is practical. 
11.2.1.3.  Coordinate requests for changes to funded IMA requirements/authorizations through the servicing IMA Readiness Management Group (RMG) detachment to identify adverse personnel impact.  (Note:  MAJCOM level approval authority for changes to requirements rests with the active duty MAJCOM, not the RMG detachment). 
11.2.1.4.  Review unfunded IMA requirements every three years and delete requirements that are no longer valid. 
11.2.1.5.  Submit requests to fund validated IMA requirements to HQ AFRC/A1M.  Requests must include a proposed funding strategy to include realigning resources already used by the command, coordinated offsets from another command, or requests for new funding in the next budget cycle. 
11.2.2.  Organizations/agencies external to the Air Force will: 
11.2.2.1.  Process requests IAW with DoDI 1235.11, Management of Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs). 
11.2.2.2.  Submit validated IMA requirements to AFRC/A1M, through SAF/AARX for review and resource options. 
11.2.3.  Air Force organizations, below MAJCOM level, having a requirement for an IMA, will forward IMA requests to their servicing MO for review, coordination and validation.  (T-1).  The servicing MO will follow the guidelines and criteria in this chapter to process the request. 
11.2.4.  HQ AFRC/A1M Responsibilities: 
11.2.4.1.  Provide guidance to manpower offices on the IMA program. 
11.2.4.2.  Review all requests to ensure IMA requirements meet the established criteria. 
11.2.4.3.  Program and manage IMA resources.  (Note:  All decisions pertaining to the funding of IMA requirements will be made by AF/RE.) 
11.3.  Criteria.  As provided for in DoDI 1235.11, IMA requirements may be established to support mobilization (including pre- and/or post-mobilization requirements), contingency operations, or other specialized or technical requirements to augment the active duty component structure.  Use the following guidelines when validating IMA manpower requirements: 
11.3.1.  Mobilization.  Mobilization is the process by which the nation makes the transition from a normal peacetime preparedness state to a warfighting state.  It involves the assembly, organization and application of the nation’s resources for national defense and it encompasses all activities necessary to prepare systematically and selectively for war.  A federal active duty status applying specifically to Title 10 United States Code, Section 12302 (Partial Mobilization) and Title 10 United States Code, Section 12301 (a) (Full/Total Mobilization) in which an Airman is involuntarily called to active duty for the period specified in the applicable statute.  IMA requirements earned under this criterion should match the Active Duty UMD requirement/ position to be backfilled or augmented. 
11.3.2.  Contingency operations.  The principal uses of IMAs under this criterion in support of manpower requirements related to Air and Space Expeditionary Forces (AEF) are as follows: (a) to backfill active duty positions that deploy from an AEF location; (b) fill a recurring AEF deployment requirement; or (c) augment Air Staff, MAJCOM and numbered air force (NAF) staff functions that must expand operations during these operations.  The key basis for IMAs justified under this category requires that the IMA position either reduce the operations tempo (OPTEMPO) of the active force, provide workload relief for units that lose personnel on steady state deployment requirements, or augment MAJCOM or NAF staffs not manned to handle the expanded hours associated with contingency operations.  IMA requirements earned under this criterion should match the Active Duty UMD requirement/ position to be backfilled or augmented. 
11.3.3.  Specialized, technical, or scientific.  To augment active forces when the workload is mission essential and to maintain a military capability requiring specialized, technical, or scientific knowledge or experience in scope not otherwise available in the active duty force. 
11.4.  Additional Guidelines. 
11.4.1.  IMA wartime authorizations.  Before requesting IMA authorizations to satisfy wartime requirements, designate manpower made available by planned wartime reductions or eliminating peacetime workloads. 
11.4.2.  Central/Single Manager Programs.  IMAs with AFSCs in the chaplain, medical, legal and intelligence career fields are designated as "centrally managed" at AFRC.  All requests for new IMA authorizations with these AFSCs must be coordinated with the appropriate AFRC functional manager.  Additionally,  Air Force Office of Special Investigation (AFOSI) is designated as a single manager for all IMAs in the AFOSI community. 
11.4.3.  General Officer requirements.  The Reserve General Officer Baseline Study periodically reviews and validates requirements and authorizations for general officers and mobilization assistants (MA).  The study is the basis for changes in requirements/authorizations to the gaining command for inclusion in MPES.  AF/REG is the OPR for the baseline study. 
11.4.4.  Days allocated for use of Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard, (or Air Reserve Forces (ARC)), officers, NCOs and airmen are commonly referred to as Military Personnel 
Appropriation (MPA) man-days because they are funded out of the military personnel appropriation account, an active duty account.  AFI 36-2619, Military Personnel Appropriate (MPA) Man-Day Program, has a fuller explanation of both MPAs and man-days. 
11.5.  Restrictions.  IMAs may not be authorized for the following purposes: 
11.5.1.  To augment ARC force structure. 
11.5.2.  To augment ANG units. 
11.5.3.  To replace military personnel expected to be unavailable for duty because of leave, hospitalization, professional military education, or other temporary reason. 
11.5.4.  To replace civilian employees who are Ready Reservists of the military services. 
11.5.5.  To manage and train AFRC personnel when that is the sole justification for an IMA requirement.  (Note:  MAJCOMs may use management and training of IMA personnel as partial justification for an IMA requirement, provided the MAJCOM can demonstrate that proficiency in the IMA’s primary responsibilities will not be degraded; use of the IMA is economical and the IMA will exercise leadership and management skills required of the position and rank.)  Additionally, MAJCOMs may assign administrative management of IMAs to a senior IMA position as long as it has a valid primary tasking.  Active duty personnel within the MAJCOM retain primary responsibility for managing IMA program operations. 
11.6.  Requirements Validation Process.  Processes for validating IMA requirements stem from responsibilities delineated in DoDI 1235.11. 
11.6.1.  Requests for IMA requirements generated within HAF and MAJCOMS will be initiated by the using organization; coordinated with the using Command Program Manager and Centrally Managed Program Manager, as appropriate; and forwarded to the servicing manpower function for review, coordination, validation and approval consideration. 
11.6.2.  The using organization initiates requests for IMA requirements generated within OSD, Defense Agencies, Joint Staff, Unified Combatant Commands or other organizations and agencies external to the USAF.  The servicing manpower organization validates it and forwards to AF/REX. 
11.6.3.  IMAs may require 24 or 48 Inactive Duty for Training periods (IDT).  Twenty-four IDTs are generally sufficient to perform the required AFSC proficiency and ancillary training.  Forty-eight IDTs may be validated with sufficient justification.

Chapter 13 
INDIVIDUAL MOBILIZATION AUGMENTEE (IMA) GENERAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES 
13.1.  General Information.  This chapter applies to IMA authorizations below the rank of Brig Gen at HAF, MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs and Defense Agencies. 
13.2.  Controlled Program Elements (PE).  This instruction applies to IMA authorizations in controlled PEs, such as the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) or Special Operations Forces (SOF); authorizations cannot be reallocated between controlled PEs or non-controlled and controlled PEs.  (Note:  This guidance does not apply to IMAs assigned to COCOMs. Procedures will be developed for rebalancing COCOM requirements). 
13.3.  Execution Data.  AFRC/RMG provides AFRC/A1M a listing of IMA authorizations that have been chronically vacant.  AFRC/RMG and AFRC/A1M determine the number of vacancies that will be divested from each organization.  IMA authorizations that are identified as either surplus to requirements or no longer linked to active component missions, or authorizations no longer required by organizations may also be added to the pool for reallocation; e.g., IMAs from inactivated organizations. 
13.4.  Requirements.  AFRC/A1M requests HAF, MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, and Defense Agencies submit their unfunded IMA requirements, by RIC, AFSC, OSC and Grade in a prioritized ‘1-to-N’ list/specified format.  AFRC/A1M notifies HAF, MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, and Defense Agencies not to submit hard to fill requirements.  Submissions will include the reason for the requirement; i.e., mobilization, contingency operations, specialized, scientific, technical, and economic or other operations IAW Paragraph 11.3 
13.5.  Allocation Model.  AF/A9 has developed a model for allocating IMAs based on several criteria including stressed career fields, CSAF priorities and the ‘1-to-N’ prioritized list.  AFRC/A1M and AF/REXX will revalidate the criteria before each IPR and AF/REXX will submit the ‘1-to-N’ requirements list, the allocation criteria, and the number of positions to reallocate to AF/A9 who then uses the model to provide a proposed allocation. 
13.6.  Allocation and Programming Guidance. 
13.6.1.  Reallocations that zero balance by RIC and Budget Sub-Activity (BSA) can be implemented immediately upon AF/RE approval.  Reallocations that don’t zero balance must be submitted in RAPIDS in the next POM before they can be implemented on the UMD. 
13.6.2.  AF/A1M and AF/REXX makes any adjustments to the allocation deemed necessary, coordinates it with the appropriate offices and obtains AF/RE approval.  AF/RE signs letters notifying organizations of their new IMA allocations. 
13.6.3.  AFRC/A1M, AF/REXX and HAF, MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, and Defense Agency manpower offices/activities implement their allocations on the UMD IAW established MPES procedures.  Allocations will be implemented immediately if a Zero Balance Transaction (ZBT) or in the program year if they require POM approval.  AF/REXX programs the allocation in the FYDP at the earliest opportunity. 
13.6.4.  AFRC/A1M maintains HAF, MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, and Defense Agency IMA allocations and insures UMDs balance to the FYDP IAW AFI 38-204. 
13.7.  Out of Cycle Requests.  HAF, MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs and Defense Agencies may submit urgent, high priority requests for IMAs with commensurate offsets to AFRC/A1M.  AFRC/A1M and AF/REXX will recommend approval/disapproval based on the allocation criteria and the potential for filling the requirements. 
13.7.1.  HAF, MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs and Defense Agencies may fund IMA requirements by submitting them, with an offset, in their organization’s POM; however, they must first be submitted to AFRC/A1M for validation.  AFRC/A1M can, in certain situations, divest proposed offsets from submitting organizations if the offsets are proposed for a drastic mission change to a lower priority mission.  A low priority mission is defined as one that is not listed on the CSAF’s priorities, the Air Force stressed career list, or any other Air Force wide document addressing service wide manpower priorities.  Emphasis will be placed on approving realignments to mission areas of high interest to AFR for potential unitization; i.e., conversion from IMA to a traditional reservist (TR) should the mission prove amenable to a unit concept. 
Chapter 14 
IMA PROGRAM REVIEW (IPR) TIMELINE 
14.1.  IPR Process. 
14.1.1.  AFRC/A1M submits an annual IPR request to HAF, MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, and Defense Agencies during the January timeframe.  The IPR data call will contain a sample IPR spreadsheet with specific MPES fields and a suspense date will be specified at that time.  AFRC/A1M will review and consolidate all IPR inputs and forward to AF/REXX for prioritization (See paragraph 14.2., Annual IPR Process Timeline). 
14.1.2.  The AF/RE Mobilization Assistant is given the opportunity to review the outcome of the provisional IPR.  The AF/RE Mobilization Assistant will share the results with their MA counterpart at the Air Force office and/or Defense Agencies affected by the IPR reallocation to acquire feedback prior to the official implementation.  Concerns will be addressed prior to final approval. 
14.1.3.  Upon AFRC/CC (or AF/RE) approval of the IMA reallocation plan, AFRC/A1M will forward the reallocation spreadsheet to each servicing manpower office/activity for UMD update.  MAJCOMs/Agencies will be allowed sufficient time to submit requests for IMA resourcing in the annual POM/Budget cycle. 
14.2.  Annual IPR Process Timeline (see Figure 14  1). 
14.2.1.  January.  AFRC/A1M requests servicing manpower offices conduct their own IMA Program Review to realign positions and then submit their list of prioritized and unfunded requirements to AFRC/A1M. 
14.2.2.  February/March.  The servicing manpower office conducts the IPR.  For prior year President’s Budget (PB) releases, the servicing MAJCOM/ A1M will work with AFRC/A1M to implement on the UMD. 
14.2.3.  April.  The servicing manpower offices submit their IPR results, to include realignments and new requirements, to AFRC/A1M. 
14.2.4.  May/June.  AFRC/A1M will review and consolidate the IPR results and AF/REX will prioritize the results based on Air Force priorities. 
14.2.5.  July/August/September.  AF/REX will develop the allocation plan and obtain AF/RE and AF/RE MA approval.  AF/REX will also send an information copy of the allocation plan to the servicing manpower offices, as well as to senior MAs and adjudicate any comments from servicing manpower offices and MAs, and obtain AF/RE approval and allocate to the servicing manpower offices.  Lastly, AF/REX provides a copy of the plan to the AFRC Functional Managers for review and recommendation of IMA authorization allocation. 
14.2.6.  December.  AF/RE will submit realignments and/or reallocations into the AFRC POM (most likely as a ZBT) and servicing manpower offices will submit requirements, not funded in IPR, into their own POM if desired.

15.4.6.2.  Notify AFRC MIF when any WLF, or other source(s), are no longer valid. 
15.4.7.  Serve as the OPR for post study resolution of issues concerning measurement input data and standard application results with field representatives. 
15.4.8.  Review Study Summary and provide acknowledgement; disagreements must be substantiated with complete rationale.  Disagreements based solely on manpower reductions cannot be accommodated. 
15.5.  AFRC/A1MP Responsibilities. 
15.5.1.  AFRC/A1MP has responsibility for management and oversight of the command FYDP manpower resources, Headquarters/DRU requirements, management and oversight of  the Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) requirements and resources program, Organization, and Manpower Data System, i.e., Manpower Programming and Execution System (MPES).  This branch is the command’s focal point for addressing all manpower actions (initiatives, disconnects, offsets, and zero balance transactions) addressed during the various AF PPBE exercises (POM, PB, etc.).  AFRC/A1MP also: 
15.5.2.  Provides AFRC MIF with an initial UMD baseline for functions under study. 
15.5.3.  Maintains a stable UMD baseline through completion of a manpower study by placing a ‘freeze’ on any UMD updates/changes until the study is completed. 
15.5.4.  Manages and oversees the command’s active duty grade requirements for colonels and CMSgts and the Air Force-allocated grade CPG factors. 
15.5.5.  Responds to “What-if” requests for information/data from AF/RE and/or AFRC/A8. 
15.6.  AFRC/A1MR Responsibilities. 
15.6.1.  Reviews initial UMD baseline provided by AFRC/A1MP and provides AFRC MIF with final vetted/validated UMD baseline for function under study. 
15.6.2.  Notifies AFRC MIF of any manpower actions which may impact manpower studies in progress. 
15.6.3.  Provides one manpower analyst to assist during standard development workshops. 
15.6.4.  Conducts an initial application of new or revised manpower standards within one fiscal year of receiving a new approved AFRCMS. 
15.6.5.  In conjunction with the functional OPR, briefs the AFRC Corporate Structure on the manpower standard impact application results and resource impact. 
15.6.6.  Executes application results in MPES within one fiscal year of receiving a newly approved AFRCMS.  Appropriate personnel lead time will be factored into the effective date of UMD changes. 
15.6.7.  Unit Manpower Document Development and Maintenance. 
15.6.7.1.  Unit Manpower Document (UMD).  Manpower authorizations are allocated to units and reflected on the Unit Manpower Document as the authoritative source for all AFRC requirements. 
15.6.7.1.1.  The Unit Manpower Document report is a computer generated product from the Manpower Programming and Execution System (MPES) or Business Objects (BO) business intelligence reporting tool.  The UMD report reflects total force manpower position detail for funded and unfunded requirements and Non-FYDP positions.  MPES contains active duty, civilian, Traditional Reservists (TR), Active Guard Reserve (AGR), Air Reserve Technician (ART), and Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) authorizations. These requirements are indicated by the respective Resource Identification Code (RIC).  Units receive UMDs from their servicing Force Support Squadron/Flight (FSS) via the MPES.  At a minimum, it is highly recommended that units establish a requirement to receive an updated UMD quarterly. 
15.6.7.1.2.  There are two basic types of civilian requirements: 
15.6.7.1.2.1.  Air Reserve Technicians (ART).  Full-time civilian employees who are also members of the Air Force Reserve unit in which they are employed.  In addition to their civilian assignments, they are assigned to an equivalent military requirement with appropriate rank.  The ART workforce provides stable, continuous full-time management, administration, and training of the Ready Reserve and oversees the transition from a peacetime to a wartime, or national emergency situation, to ensure mobilization readiness is maintained.  ARTs train reservists, provide continuity within the Reserve unit of assignment, and support the unit’s gaining major command. 
15.6.7.1.2.2.  Civilian requirements provide peacetime support to units. 
15.6.7.1.3.  The UMD contains the military requirements. 
15.6.7.1.3.1.  Unit military drill requirements are military positions which have been established by the gaining command to accomplish the wartime mission or by HQ AFRC to satisfy other military requirements.  These are represented by RIC 0020 for officer requirements and 0120 for enlisted requirements.  Non ART drill positions constitute the units Traditional Reservist requirements. 
15.6.7.1.3.2.  IMAs are individual members of the Selected Reserve or Participating Individual Ready Reserve assigned to an active component of the DoD or other U.S. Government agency in war, contingency operations and peacetime to meet national defense, strategic national interest and domestic objectives.  These requirements are represented by RIC 0018, 0019, 0118, and 0123. 
15.6.7.1.4.  Unfunded Requirements.  Unfunded requirements are validated UMD requirements which have not been funded by Congress or the HAF.  Unfunded requirements are shown on the UMD with a MNT code of "N” or “R” in the first position of the MNT code. 
15.6.7.1.4.1.  Overhires.  Overhires are increases above current full-time funded UMD authorizations.  Funded UMD positions may not provide sufficient flexibility to meet shifting, peak, seasonal, or cyclical work load demands.  This may be particularly true in units which have a significant number of unfunded requirements.  Overhire authorizations are designed to fill this void. HQ 
AFRC/A1M recognizes there are special or unique needs for interim solutions to personnel or management problems that might be best handled by use of the overhire resource, these requests are staffed in TMT and approved by HQ AFRC/CV.  The use of the overhire resource is not intended to be a permanent replacement of true funding.  Those placed on the UMD for Uniformed Services and Reemploying Rights Act (USERRA) , 38 USC Chapter 43, will be placed for five quarters to provide for future placement of the individual. All approved overhire requests are staffed with AFRC/ A1C and AFRC/FM via an AFRC Form 261, Unfunded Requirements and Overhire Authorization Advisory. 
15.6.7.1.4.2.  Overhires are typically established when an increased requirement of a continuous nature has been validated and resources are not available to fund the authorization.  These may result from HQ AFRC/A1M application of a manpower standard; AFRC/CV directed action such as early hire approval for unit conversions; and/or out-year program objective memorandum (POM) approved/ funded UMD authorizations. 
15.6.7.1.4.3.  Implementation of Overhires to be covered in a future AFRCMAN. 
15.6.8.  Manpower Standards.  AFRC utilizes various models to determine Manpower requirements:  Manpower Standards, Manpower Guides, Command/AF Policy, etc.  The primary means of determining manpower requirements is through the application of AFRC manpower standards that result in defining fulltime equivalent (FTE).  When required, HQ AFRC/A1MR will request workload data from the functional manager to facilitate the application of the standard.  Standards are applied by AFRC/A1MR biennially. 
15.6.8.1.  Develop and maintain a schedule for the bi-annual application of approved manpower standards to determine full-time manpower requirements. 
15.6.8.2.  Perform currency reviews in conjunction with bi-annual application of manpower standards. 
15.6.8.3.  Notify the affected NAF/A1M and affected AFRC FAM 60 days before a scheduled AFRCMS application.  The notification will include all workload reporting requirements and any other information required to apply the AFRCMS. 
15.6.8.4.  Ensure  FAM reviews the POD for currency to identify work no longer performed, or work processes that have changed since the standard was developed; additionally, the FAM must justify all proposed changes with regulatory (i.e., AFI) references and supporting documentation. 
15.6.8.5.  Ensure FAM  reviews each workload factor definition and source of count and certify that they are still accurate.  If they are no longer valid, the FAM must provide a written explanation of changes. 
15.6.8.6.  Forward  FAM identified changes to the standard to AFRC MIF.  The FAM, AFRC MIF, and AFRC/A1MR will jointly determine whether the standard is valid, needs administrative update, or rescinded.  If rescinded, may be used as a guide until a new standard is published. 
15.6.8.7.  Analyze the workload data for extremes or trends and resolve data anomalies with the functional OPR.  There may be approved program changes that will result in 
data that will be significantly different than historical workload data averages.  In these cases, it is more appropriate to use projected workload for determining manpower requirements or less than a full year of workload data.  For example, if a manpower standard uses flying hours to determine manpower requirements, and a unit is approved to add 2000 flying hours in the next few months, do not use the ‘historical’ average. 
15.6.8.8.  Coordinate all standard application results impacting resources with Chief, Program Development Branch (AFRC/A1MP).  If a standard application reduces requirements, unfunded positions will be removed before funded.  If requirements increase, resources will be added as unfunded requirements until sourcing is identified.  Excess resources will be returned to the AFRC Corporate Structure to be applied to AFRC corporate priorities. 
15.6.8.9.  Perform out-of-cycle reapplication of standards as  required in support of  short notice mission changes, force structure changes, flying hour changes, significant shifts in population, etc. 
15.6.8.10.  Ensure authorized military grades on full-time positions are compatible with AFSC and skill level requirements in the AFRCMS when specified and Career Progression Group (CPGs) limitations. 
15.6.8.11.  Determining manpower requirements using alternative methods such as staffing patterns, or post manning when no AFRCMS is applicable. 
15.6.9.  Determining Military Manpower Requirements. 
15.6.9.1.  Validate military requirements by reviewing UTAs, DOC Taskings, new or modified Unit Type Codes (UTCs), TFI guidance, COCOM requirements, LCOM, and Active Duty manpower standards during the initial development and staffing process to validate manpower requirements and determine AFRC manpower impact.  Determine military status (TR, ART, AGR, IMA) through application of the FTS Manpower decision matrix contained in AFI 36-2132, Full-Time Support (FTS) to the Air Force Reserve. 
15.6.9.2.  Determine authorized military grades (GRD) by applying AFRC grade distribution to be defined in a future AFRCMAN.  With a few exceptions, the minimum authorized grade on AFRC UMDs is staff sergeant for enlisted, and major for officer positions.  Exceptions must be submitted by the respective FAM and approved by AFRC/CV. 
15.7.  FYDP/UMD Reconciliation. 
15.7.1.  AFRC/A1MP is responsible for manpower resources allocation per AFI 38-204. 
15.7.2.  AFRC/A1MR will reconcile funded UMD to allocated manpower resources and ensure AFRC/A8 panel chair obtains program over-execution authority from AF/RE prior to over-allocation of resources on the UMD.  Develop and coordinate “What-if” requests presented by AF/RE or AFRC/A8. 
15.8.  Manpower Change Request (MCR) Process. 
15.8.1.  General Information.  Submit an MCR on AFRC Form 106, Manpower Change Request, when a UMD change is required. 
15.8.1.1.  Submit MCRs pertaining to the NAF or a reserve unit to HQ AFRC/A1MR   MCRs are normally submitted by units; however, numbered air forces (NAF) or HQ AFRC staff elements may submit MCRs on the units’ behalf.  NAF/A1Ms shall advise unit personnel on the preparation and submission of AFRC Form 106 and forward any questions or request for clarification on procedures to appropriate AFRC/A1MR analyst. 
15.8.1.2.  Submit MCRs for the HQ AFRC staff and direct reporting units to HQ AFRC/A1MP.  (T-1).  The director or special staff chief can submit the request for change.  (T-1). 
15.8.1.3.  Locally "assumed" missions and "desired" capabilities, or “personal” prerogative are not acceptable reasons to request a UMD change. 
15.9.  Zero-Balance MCRs: 
15.9.1.  Each request for an increase in UMD authorizations must be accompanied by a proposal for an equivalent offsetting resource/decrease from elsewhere.  (T-1). 
15.9.2.  Zero-balance changes will result in a ‘no cost’ action to the command.  Failure to identify an off-setting authorization will delay processing or result in disapproval.  (T-1). 
15.9.3.  Non-Zero Balance (NZBT)  is any action that increases authorizations, skill level or grade of a requirement or moves funding between PECs without a corresponding offset. NZBT requests expend Command resources thus require a minimum of AFRC/CV approval.   (T-1). 
15.10.  MCRs in Cost Compared Areas: 
15.10.1.  Functional areas operating under a most efficient organization (MEO), based on an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 cost comparison, are not prohibited from submitting changes.  To ensure all levels of review for MCRs, in functions involved in, or the result of, an A-76 Cost Comparison, the following statement must be included on the AFRC Form 106: "I certify that the manpower change outlined in this request will not cause this unit to exceed the government cost estimate as outlined in OMB Circular A-76."  (T-0). 
15.10.2.  AFRC Form 106 is not required for changes in base operating support functions subject to performance work statement (PWS) revisions.  HQ AFRC MIF evaluates published PWS revisions to determine manpower impact and notify the functional office of primary responsibility (OPR) of the results.  UMDs are adjusted as required. 
15.11.  Special Circumstance Positions: 
15.11.1.  Group Superintendents. 
15.11.1.1.  Requests for Group Superintendents are a resource zero balance transaction thus an offset will be provided.  (T-1).  The offset provided should generally be in the grade of CMSgt. 
15.11.2.  Client System Technicians (CST) are earned under a 1 to 150 ratio verse fulltime population supported resulting in a fulltime CST.  (T-1).   For traditional reservists 1 to 150 ratio against Traditional Reservist (TR) positions only (TR, does not include the military position of the ART).  (T-1).  The result of this drill will be two numbers, fulltime and traditional reservist CST support respectively as directed by SAF A6.  (T-1). 
15.11.3.  There are other instances that may require corporate staffing that may provide special dispensation which will be incorporated into future revisions of this instruction or codified in the future AFRCMAN.

AIR FORCE RESERVE OFFICER AND ENLISTED MANPOWER GRADES DISTRIBUTION 
16.1.  Manpower Grade Distribution Overview.  This chapter establishes policy for an enlisted grades program for all Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) military positions at the unit level and is applicable to all enlisted grades included in Unit Manpower Document (UMD).  The intent of this distribution is to provide for a career progression group exercise for all Officer and Enlisted Air Force Specialty Codes.  It recognizes the advanced technical position of reservists and addresses career progression and recruitment issues unique to AFRC.  This policy will be used in an analogous fashion as active duty CPG exercises to affect authorized allocations and not to be used to determine grade requirements.  Although exempted from Chapter 4, Military Grades, AFRC uses this chapter for its spirit and intent as a guide where it makes sense and does not hinder the AFRC mission and or recruiting and retention efforts. 
16.2.  AFRC applies this program to the first three digits of the AFS, not including any prefix (use of AFECD and AFOCD is paramount to this policy).  An understanding of the Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) concept is integral to the application of this AFI.  Offices shall refer to the Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) Codes (Atch 5) of Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD) when determining all E-9 grades and applied IAW the future AFRCMAN, when published. 
16.3.  The authorized grade, identified as “grade” on the UMD, will be constrained to no more than one grade higher than the required grade.  (T-1). 
16.4.  This distribution will be applied during significant mission changes and during Design Operational Capability/UTC Availability (DOC/ UTA) reviews.  (T-1). 
16.5.  Movement of grades between AFSCs will not be authorized as grades are not a commodity for trading.  (T-1).  Movement would disrupt the CPG of each AFSC and cause a need to reapply the guide to retain a proper pyramid for career progression.  Grades are earned in order to maintain proper skill level to be successful at the mission for the unit/office they are allocated. 
16.6.  AFRC Enlisted Grade Percentages.  The below percentages are the cornerstone of the AFRC Enlisted Grades Program and are applicable to all AFRC field level units.  They are defendable to Air Staff, and are not to be exceeded as they represent a percentage of total AFRC funded enlisted end-strength. 
16.6.1.  Operations “Rated Aircrew:” 
16.6.1.1.  CMSgt – 3.2%. 
16.6.1.2.  SMSgt – 5.4%. 
16.6.1.3.  MSgt - 23%. 
16.6.1.4.  TSgt - 41%. 
16.6.1.5.  SSgt – 22.4%. 
16.6.2.  All Others: 
16.6.2.1.  CMSgt – 1.6%. 
16.6.2.2.  SMSgt – 5.4%. 
16.6.2.3.  MSgt - 17%. 
16.6.2.4.  TSgt - 28%. 
16.6.2.5.  SSgt - 48%. 
16.7.  Officer Support and Maintenance Grades: 
16.7.1.  Required Grade: 
16.7.1.1.  Establish O2 and O3 requirements as Captain 
16.7.1.2.  Establish O4 requirements as Major 
16.7.1.3.  Establish O5 requirements as Lt Colonel 
16.7.1.4.  Establish O6 requirements as Colonel 
16.7.2.  Authorized Grade: 
16.7.2.1.  Applied by AFS, exclude directed requirements (i.e. Commanders) 
16.7.2.2.  Establish all Captains as Major 
16.7.2.3.  Establish 37.5% as Lt Colonel and 62.5%  as Major 
16.8.  Officer Operations grades will be defined in a future AFRCMAN due to the specific nature of MPES requirements. 
Chapter 17 
AIRCREW MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS 
17.1.  Overview.  Public Law and Air Force policy establish specific restrictions on aircrew manpower authorizations.  To comply with these restrictions, all organizations must strictly control aircrew authorization growth.  All changes to aircrew requirements (except flight surgeons) must be approved no later than one year prior to the date of the proposed requirement change.  This one-year lead time provides time to implement any necessary changes in aircrew production or manning levels to support the change.  The Manpower community is responsible for determining and documenting Aircrew Manpower Requirements.  All changes to aircrew authorizations must be coordinated with Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, Plans and Requirements, Directorate of Force Management (AF/A3O-A).  This chapter does not apply to the ARC.  AFI 11-412, Aircrew Management, establishes aircrew management procedures. 
17.2.  Roles and Responsibilities. 
17.2.1.  Headquarters Air Force. 
17.2.1.1.  AF/A1M determines and validates the aircrew manpower requirements in coordination with AF/A3O and maintains the MPES database for aircrew manpower requirements and authorizations (with exception of the Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training Flying Training Resource Allocation Programming model in AETC). 
17.2.1.2.  AF/A3O establishes the rated baseline(s) for MAJCOM operations (A3) and provides an information copy to the MAJCOM manpower staff using end of FY requirements.  The baseline will set each command’s maximum total pilots, combat system officers (CSO), air battle managers (ABM) and Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) pilots by category. 
17.2.1.3.  AF/A3O-A. 
17.2.1.3.1.  Evaluates requests for new positions and changes to existing authorizations and forwards approval or disapproval to the requester.  Helps identify offsets to growth requirements, where appropriate and directed. 
17.2.1.3.2.  Ensures approved and funded crew ratio changes are incorporated into AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors.  Suspense for change inputs is 31 December of each year.  See paragraph 15.3.1 regarding the process to establish or change a crew ratio or crew complement. 
17.2.1.3.3.  Updates aircrew authorizations estimate using funded aircrew ratios. 
17.2.1.3.4.  Analyzes annual review of aircrew authorizations from each MAJCOM manpower staff and joint command or agency and returns comments or required corrections as needed. 
17.2.1.3.5.  Maintains the Aircrew 480 System (A480S).  The A480S is a web-based tool providing multi-level coordination and approval of new and changed aircrew manpower authorizations.  The system maintains a record of aircrew requirements for review and analysis. 
17.2.1.4.  The Air Force Medical Support Agency, Healthcare Operations (AFMSA/SG3) evaluates requests for new Aircrew Position Identifier (API) 5 positions or changes to existing authorizations and forwards approval or disapproval to the originator.  See Table 17.1 for a list of the API codes. 
17.2.2.  MAJCOM level (including DRUs and FOAs). 
17.2.2.1.  Functional OPR. 
17.2.2.1.1.  Assigns aircrew AFSCs only to those positions with duties clearly requiring aircrew skills as described in the AFOCD and AFECD found on the MA website.  Ensures aircrew positions are established at the lowest organizational level consistent with mission requirements. 
17.2.2.1.2.  Assigns a functional OPR to coordinate changes to aircrew authorizations with AF/A3O-A and to coordinate flight surgeon requirements with AFMSA/SG3.  Forwards OPR information to AF/A3O-A and AFMSA/SG3. 
17.2.2.1.3.  Submits all changes and new requests in sufficient time to be approved no later than one year prior to the date of the proposed requirement change.  This provides time to implement any necessary changes in aircrew production or manning levels to support the change.  MAJCOMs (ACC, AETC, AFGSC, AFMC, AFSOC, AFSPC, AMC, PACAF and USAFE) have been delegated responsibility for management of non-API 5 aircrew requirements (grade, API, AFSC, etc.) within overall Aircrew Specialty (pilots, CSOs, ABMs and RPAs and Career Enlisted Aviators (CEA)) and Major Weapon System (MWS) Category (Fighter, Bomber, Mobility, etc.) levels determined by AF/A3O-A.  All other organizations must coordinate any changes to aircrew authorizations with AF/A3O-A.  Reserve components must coordinate any change in Regular Air Force aircrew positions with AF/A3O-A.  (Note:  All aircrew positions must be documented and approved, either with an AF Form 480, Aircrew AFSC / Active Flying Justification, or electronic equivalent, through channels to AF/A3O-A, per AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Aviation Badges). 
17.2.2.1.4.  Submits all changes and new requests for rated justification for flight surgeon positions (API 5) directly to AFMSA/SG3. 
17.2.2.1.5.  Identifies potential offsetting authorizations for new aircrew requirements.  Additions or changes to aircrew requirements are possible only with offsets within the same aircrew specialty and MWS category.  Offsetting authorizations are also required for any aircrew changes generated by new manpower standards or the reapplication of existing manpower standards. 
17.2.2.2.  Operations (A3).  Approves additions or changes to aircrew authorizations (except flight surgeons) and maintains the command’s baseline requirements.  Any change to the baseline requirements must be approved in advance by AF/A3O-A.  The functional OPR maintains a current file of all AF Forms 480 or A480S electronic equivalent. 
17.2.2.3.  Surgeon General.  Manages the justification process for flight surgeons with API 5 as described in AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.  For requirements not covered 
by a manpower standard, submit the AF Form 480 or A480S electronic equivalent directly to AFMSA/SG3. 
17.2.2.4.  AF/A1M.  Assigns aircrew AFSCs with applicable API codes only to those positions where duties clearly require aircrew skills as described in the AFOCD and AFECD found on the AFPC/MA website.  Ensures aircrew positions are established at the lowest organizational level consistent with mission requirements, and coordinates with the MAJCOM A3 or equivalent to validate aircrew requirement changes and the annual review of aircrew authorizations.  Updates manpower requirement API codes in MPES to reflect approval of new or changed positions—an aircrew AFSC without an API is not a valid position. 
17.2.3.  Installation Level. 
17.2.3.1.  Installation functional managers will forward requests for new authorizations, and changes to existing authorizations, to the installation manpower office, who in turn will forward to the MAJCOM manpower staff for validation and coordination with the MAJCOM functional authority.  (T-1).  The installation functional manager will also conduct an annual review of aircrew authorizations as directed by the MAJCOM; maintain a current file of all AF Form 480 or equivalent A480S data electronically, document supporting justification (include AF Form 480 or A480S electronic equivalent, as required) and coordinate aircrew position requests with the installation manpower office.  (T-1). 
17.2.3.2.  The installation manpower office will coordinate with the functional authority on aircrew data changes and the annual review of aircrew authorizations and submit MPES changes to the MAJCOM manpower staff.  (T-1). 
17.3.  Specific Areas of Responsibility. 
17.3.1.  Crew Ratio or Crew Complements. 
17.3.1.1.  Existing Crew Ratios or Crew Complements.  MAJCOM-level Strategic Plans and Programs (A8) submits proposed changes to existing crew ratios or crew complements to the Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Plan and Programs, Directorate of Programs (AF/A8P), with a copy provided to AF/A3O-A.  AF/A8P will coordinate the proposed change with AF/A1M and AF/A3O-A.  Once AF/A8P approves the proposed changes, they will inform the MAJCOM-level manpower function for programming and AF/A3O-A who will ensure that funded changes are made to AFI 65-503.  Changes must be received by AF/A3O-A no later than 31 December to be included in the annual update to AFI 65-503. 
17.3.1.2.  New Crew Ratios or Crew Complements.  Lead commands submit proposed crew ratios and crew complements with justification as part of the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for aircraft scheduled to enter the inventory.  These ORDs require AF/A3O coordination.  Once the ORD is approved, AF/A8P will inform AF/A3O-A, who will ensure that the changes are made to AFI 65-503.  Changes must be received by AF/A3O-A not later than 31 December to be included in the annual update to AFI 65-503.  Note:   For approval of nonrated or non-CEA aircrew “X-prefixed” (non-API coded) Duty Air Force Specialty Code (DAFSC) positions, submit an AF Forms 480 or electronic equivalent through channels to AF/A3O-A IAW AFI 11-402. 
17.3.2.  Programmed Flying Training (PFT) Positions. 
17.3.2.1.  Forward methodology used to determine PFT instructor requirements, including any methodology changes or deviations, to AF/A3O-A.  Document all PFT methodologies as a policy directive, pamphlet, or operating instruction. 
17.3.2.2.  MAJCOM Operations (A3), in coordination with their MAJCOM manpower staff, will submit advanced student requirements to AF/A3O-A as required by AFI 11-412.  Summarize these requirements by Mission Design Series (MDS), course number and crew position for each year of the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).  Determine all advanced student requirements (average daily student load) by multiplying approved annual student production or loads by course length in calendar days and dividing by the number of training days with a given year (i.e., AETC flying training days per year is 246 for 2009). 
17.3.2.3.  As the PFT student load changes, instructor requirements will likely change.  Commands that conduct formal aircrew training will submit instructor aircrew change requests to AF/A1M who coordinates with AF/A3O-A for approval. 
17.3.3.  Positions based on manpower standards.  For flying unit staff positions based on manpower standards (e.g., operational support squadron positions), MAJCOM/A1Ms must submit proposed changes to existing aircrew manpower standards or reapplication of existing manpower standards with justification through AFPC/CC to AF/A1M for approval.  AF/A1M forwards to AF/A3O-A for recommendation and coordination. 
17.3.4.  Other aircrew positions.  Staff positions include all aircrew positions not mentioned in above paragraphs.  The MAJCOM must provide offsetting authorizations for any new aircrew staff requirements.  Additions or changes are possible only with offsets for API codes within the same aircrew specialty.  Offsetting authorizations are also required for any aircrew staff changes generated by new manpower standards or the reapplication of existing manpower standards. 
17.4.  Coding Aircrew Manpower Requirements and Authorizations. 
17.4.1.  Aircrew Position Identifier (API) Coding.  All aircrew manpower authorizations require an API code IAW AFI 11-401, Table 2.1., to include an explanation of how the API code was determined.  All nonrated officer DAFSC positions will be assigned API 0 and non-CEA enlisted positions will be assigned API Z.  Table 17.1 lists all API codes.

17.4.2.  Manpower Standard Implementation (MSI) code.  The MSI code is a key indicator concerning the management of aircrew authorizations.  It is essential MAJCOM manpower staffs maintain correct MSI codes in MPES tied to aircrews.  The MSI code for “crew ratio” is “F”. 
17.5.  Annual Aircrew Authorization Review.  During the annual review of aircrew authorizations, the following must be accomplished, per AFI 11-412, Aircrew Management: 
17.5.1.  Revalidate all API 1/2/9/A and aircrew prefixed (nonrated or non-CEA) DAFSC requirements and verify correct application of all API attributes. 
17.5.2.  Review and revalidate all aircrew staff positions to ensure aviator expertise is required.  If desired, staff reviews may be accomplished in quarterly increments; forward the results of the annual review to AF/A3O-A no later than 31 October of each year. 
17.5.3.  The CFM or functional OPR maintains a current file of all AF Forms 480 (or maintains equivalent data electronically). 
17.6.  Aircrew Manpower Requirements and Authorizations Documentation. 
17.6.1.  Pilot, CSO, ABM, and RPA pilot requirements in AFSCs other than 11X/12X/13B and 18X must have a “P” or “N” prefix to specify a Rated requirement.  The AFOCD found on the MA website establishes which AFSCs are authorized to have the “P” or “N” prefix.  In addition, the AFOCD requires a suffix to be added indicating the required MWS background (e.g., P62E3W, P10C0P).  This suffix takes precedence over normal AFSC shred-out codes. 
17.6.2.  An AF Form 480, Rated Position Description, (or electronic equivalent) is required for all positions except those with a grade of colonel (O-6) or higher. The AF Form 480 or A480S form must clearly justify the requirement for aviator expertise (see Attachment 7 for instructions). 
17.6.3.  The AF Form 480, or A480S electronic equivalent, justification is a unique combination of AFSC, API code, duty description and aviator justifications.  Except for O-6 and higher positions, any changes to the duty requirements that substantially alter the basis for the original position approval invalidate the original AF Form 480.  The position must be revalidated and resubmitted for approval to MAJCOM A3 Aircrew Managers (for MAJCOM billets), AFMOA/SG3 (for API 5 Billets), or AF/A3O-A for all other billets.  Changes to 
MPES are not authorized to be effective prior to approval.  In addition, approval is required for the following changes: 
17.6.3.1.  Changing from one rated specialty to another rated specialty (e.g., pilot to NAV or ABM to pilot). 
17.6.3.2.  Changing from a generalist AFSC (e.g., 11G3, 12G4, P62E3W, N80C0W) to a MWS generalist or specific AFSC (e.g., 11F3Y, 12B3A, P62E3P, N80C0R). 
17.6.3.3.  Changing from a MWS generalist AFSC (e.g., 11F3Y, 12B4Y) to a MWS-specific AFSC (e.g., 11F3F, 12B4A). 
17.6.3.4.  Changing from one MWS AFSC to another MWS AFSC (e.g., 11M3Y to 11F3Y). 
17.6.3.5.  Changing from one AFS to another (e.g., 1A0XX to 1A2XX). 
17.6.3.6.  Changes in API code from non-flying duties to flying duties (e.g., API 3 to 6, API E to D). 
17.6.3.7.  Transfers of an authorization from one command or joint agency to another. 
17.6.3.8.  Additions of new non-rated officer or non-CEA enlisted aircrew prefixed (X-prefix) DAFSC positions per AFI 11-402.

Terms 
Authorized End Strength—The count of Air Force military and civilian positions the Air Force needs to have funded and cannot exceed, in each year of the FYDP to accomplish all approved 
missions.  FYDP end strength is allocated to Commands by program element code (PEC) and category (officer, enlisted and civilian). 
Centrally Managed—Functions with IMAs in chaplain (HC), medical (SG) or legal (JA) career fields, in which all IMA requirements are ‘centrally’ managed HQ AFRC functional manager.  Any request to add or eliminate one of these IMA specialties must be coordinated with the appropriate HQ AFRC functional manager. 
Chronically Vacant—IMA authorizations that have not been filled for more than 18 consecutive months. 
Contract Full—Time Equivalent—A CFTE is a calculated based on a 2080 annual hours as mandated in The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-272, April 7, 1986) which amended 5 U.S.C. 5504(b).  Prior to then an hourly rate of basic pay was computed by dividing the employee's annual rate of basic pay by 2,080 hours (the number of hours in 52 workweeks of 40 hours) and rounding to the nearest cent.  This formula presumes a calendar year consisting of exactly 52 weeks or 364 days. However, a calendar year actually consists of either 365 or 366 days. Thus, a calendar year may have more paid workdays than a 52-week year. A General Accounting Office study published in 1981 demonstrated that over a 28-year period (the period of time it takes for the calendar to repeat itself) there are, on average, 2,087 work hours per calendar year. This average results from the fact there are usually 4 years with 262 workdays (2,096 hours), 17 years with 261 workdays (2,088 hours), and 7 years with 260 workdays (2,080 hours). The 2,087 divisor is derived from the following formula: (2,096 hours*4 years) + (2,088 hours*17 years) + (2,080 hours*7 years) / 28 years = 2,087.143 hours. Using 2,087 as the average number of work hours in a calendar year reasonably accommodates the year-to-year fluctuations in work hours. 
Controlled Program Element—Any program that is funded outside of AFRC and controlled by a separate agency, such as Special Operations Forces or Military Intelligence Program. 
Enterprise-Wide Contract Manpower Reporting Application—The ECMRA is an online data system that automates the collection of contractor labor hours, from direct contractor inputs, to improve DoD visibility of contractor services.  The ECMRA captures information of the funding source, contract vehicle, organization supported, the function being performed, the labor hours, and labor costs for contracted services. 
Full Commercial Activities Exempt—Commercial Activities that are exempted from private sector performance by law, Executive Order (EO), treaty, or international agreement (IA). 
Full—Time Equivalent—A FTE is a measure of workload; a daily work allocation is 8 hours, and a yearly allocation may be 2080 hours (40 hours per week for 52 weeks).  An individual's work duration may be determined based on the person's FTE in the following way, for a given period of two work days: 0.75 FTE (assumed) x 2 workdays (given) x 8 hours per workday (typical allocation rate) = 12 hours work duration. 
Inherently Governmental/Commercial Activity—Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act of 1998, Public Law 105-270, mandates that all functions within the federal government be coded into one of three categories, Inherently Governmental (IG) , Commercial Activity Exempt (CE), or Commercial Activity (CA).  This act serves two primary functions, ensure IG functions remain in-house and to achieve savings and effectiveness of CAs through cost analysis.  The act further mandates that the coding of all Air Force authorizations, with the exception of Non-
appropriated Fund (NAF) and some intelligence authorizations, be reported to Congress on an annual basis. 
Inventory for Contract Services (ICS)—As required by U.S.C. Title 10, Section 2330a, the intent of the ICS is for the DoD to provide an inventory of contract service support, to include the contractor labor hours expended, and report this by the end of the 3rd quarter of the next fiscal year.   This includes a service-level review of the inventory to ensure contractors are not performing inherently governmental work; that to the maximum extent, contractors are not performing close to inherently governmental work; that any personal service contracts being performed are within statutory and regulatory guidance; and to identify any support contractor activities that may be considered for conversion to government performance. 
Management Advisory Study (MAS)—A consultant service offered and provided by the manpower office vis-a-vis a client/consultant relationship between the MO and the requesting unit/agency to analyze problems such as excessive overtime, meeting suspenses, high error rates, morale problems, layout analysis, paperwork flow, work distribution and misplaced manpower.  This service is not used to justify additional manpower requirements or to identify excess and/or available unit personnel.  Simply put, a MAS is a process to assist functions in identifying efficiencies and/or better ways of operating. 
Man-hour Availability Factor (MAF)—This factor is the average number of man-hours per month an assigned individual is available to do assigned duties.  Required man-hours are divided by the MAF times the overload factor to determine the manpower requirements. 
Man-hour—A unit of measuring work.  It is equivalent to one person working at a normal pace for 60 minutes, two people working at a normal pace for 30 minutes, or a similar combination of people working at a normal pace for a period of time equal to 60 minutes. 
Manpower Authorization—A funded manpower requirement with detail that defines the position in terms of its function, organization, location, skill, grade, and other appropriate characteristics which commands use to extend end strength resources to units.  May appear as a “funded” or “unfunded” authorization on the UMD and in MPES. 
Manpower Requirement—Joint Publication 1-02 defines manpower requirements as human resources needed to accomplish a specified job, workload, mission, or program.  There are two types of manpower requirements: funded and unfunded.  Funded manpower requirements are those that have been validated and allocated.  Unfunded requirements are validated manpower needs that have been deferred because of budgetary constraints.  Manpower requirements are generally determined by an Air Force Manpower Standard or other management decision. 
Manpower Standard—The basic tool used to determine the most effective and efficient level of manpower required to support a function.  It is a quantitative expression that represents a work center's man-hour requirements in response to varying levels of workload. 
Out of Cycle Request—Outside the annual IMA Program Review. 
Overload Factor—The overload factor is applied in conjunction with certain MAFs during the manpower standards application and ensures effective use of Air Force manpower authorizations. The overload factor realizes Air Force leadership‘s expectation that some overtime is an effective tool instead of adding additional manpower requirements. 
Unfunded Manpower Requirement—An approved manpower requirement on the UMD that reflects recognized and/or necessary workload, however which is not funded—meaning no individual can be assigned to, or PCSed to the position. 
USERRA—The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), 38 USC chapter 43, protects service members' reemployment rights when returning from a period of service in the uniformed services, including those called up from the reserves or National Guard, and prohibits employer discrimination based on military service or obligation. The U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS) administers USERRA.   USERRA is primarily an Air Reserve Component program. 
Unit Manpower Document (UMD)—The Unit Manpower Document report is a computer generated product from the Manpower Programming and Execution System (MPES) or Business Objects (BO) business intelligence reporting tool that contains active duty military, civilian, traditional reservists (TR), Active Guard Reserve (AGR), Air Reserve Technician (ART), and Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) authorizations.  The UMD report reflects total force manpower position information for funded authorizations, unfunded requirements, and Non-FYDP positions by unit and work center. 
Workforce Mix (WFM)—The effective determination and management of the appropriate mix of manpower categories (military personnel (Active Duty, Reserve, IMAs, and National Guard), DoD civilian employees, and contracted services) within an activity, regardless the level. 
Workload Factor (WLF)—An index or unit of measure that is consistently expressive of, or relatable to, the manpower required to accomplish the quantitatively and qualitatively defined responsibilities of a work center.

DETERMINING AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS USING MAINTENANCE MAN-HOUR PER FLYING HOUR 
A2.1.  General Instructions.  Aircraft maintenance manpower requirements are usually determined using a combination of LCOM and other available manpower standards.  As a last resort to traditional methods, aircraft maintenance manpower requirements may be determined using the MMH/FH formula.  The results of the formula, when combined with existing standards or other calculations as described below, will determine manpower requirements for an entire maintenance organization.  It will not identify requirements by individual work center. 
A2.1.1.  The following paragraphs explain the features of MMH/FH formula and other calculations that can be used. 
A2.1.1.1.  Monthly Flying Hours (MFH).  These are the total number of flying hours per month per primary aircraft authorized (PAA) flown by the Wing’s assigned squadrons. 
A2.1.1.2.  PAA.  This is the total number of aircraft authorized to support the unit’s primary mission. 
A2.1.1.3.  MMH/FH.  This is a factor developed and maintained by the owning command for each aircraft MDS assigned.  It is based on maintenance data collected from the appropriate Maintenance Data Collection (MDC) system.  Typically, MDC data information is collected for each direct-maintenance action accomplished on an MDS.  This data is totaled and then divided by the number of flying hours for that MDS.  This is normally done on a monthly basis.  The resulting quotient is called the MMH/FH Factor. 
A2.1.1.4.  Man-hour Availability Factor (MAF).  The MAF is the average number of man-hours per month an assigned individual is available to accomplish assigned duties (direct and indirect work). 
A2.1.1.5.  Overload Factor.  Certain predefined overload factors are applied with certain MAFs.  Application of the overload factor ensures effective use of Air Force manpower resources.  It is derived from Air Force leadership's expectation that our workforce can work more than an 8-hour workday before hiring additional workforce that might be partially unproductive.

A2.1.1.6.  Direct Maintenance Requirements.  This step of the computation determines aircraft maintenance manpower requirements for all flight line and back-shop.  It does not include munitions; aerospace ground equipment (AGE); aircrew flight equipment (AFE); shop support; transient maintenance; test, measurement and diagnostic equipment; and aircrew training services. 
A2.1.1.7.  Maintenance Support.  This step of the computation determines manpower requirements for those elements of maintenance work which cannot be identified with a specific aircraft. 
A2.1.1.7.1.  AGE.  The maintenance support for AGE includes credit for both powered and non-powered AGE.  When applicable, use approved manpower standards. 
A2.1.1.7.2.  Aircrew Flight Equipment.  Maintenance of AFE includes repair of flight clothing, parachute equipment, life rafts and preservers, etc.  When applicable, use approved manpower standards. 
A2.1.1.7.3.  Shop Support.  The shop support includes work performed on items withdrawn from supply (excluding engines) not related to an aircraft or other end pieces of equipment such as AGE, trainers and non-aerospace equipment and items received from non-aircraft maintenance activities.  Shop support does not include man-hours expended in AGE and AFE work centers. 
A2.1.1.8.  Additives.  This step of the computation determines manpower required for munitions maintenance and maintenance of specialized equipment (e.g., electronic countermeasures pods, mission crew capsules for the EC-130 aircraft) required by the aircraft for mission performance.  This factor is determined by the owning command. 
A2.1.1.9.  Maintenance Overhead.  This step of the computation determines manpower requirements for all activities related to managing aircraft maintenance staff support activities at the group level.  When applicable, use approved manpower standards. 
A2.1.2.  Table A2  2. shows example calculations and illustrates two scenarios.  Scenario 1 illustrates how to perform calculations when approved standards are available.  Scenario 2 illustrates how to perform calculations when no standards are available.

P 
 ACTION 
 EXAMPLE:  Scenario:  Manpower standard resulting in mhrs for FAC 42B100, Vehicle Maintenance, at an overseas base named “Base X.”  All mhrs are monthly. 
 
1. 
 Follow the instructions in the manpower standard and calculate the monthly mhrs the function requires.  Include all variances (positive and negative) expressed as mhrs.  Sum the mhrs for the manpower standard. 
 After following the manpower standard instructions for Base X, it is determined total required mhrs is 7231.49. 
 
2. 
 If part of the function is contracted out, subtract approved CFTE mhrs from the Step 1 sum to determine total in-service mhrs.  Validate CFTEs per guidance in Para 2.4. 6. before applying manpower standards.  Then multiply the number of CFTEs by the appropriate MAF (Attachment 3) to determine FTE mhrs. 
 This flight has 2 CFTEs ; therefore, 296.00 mhrs are subtracted from the total mhrs required.  NOTE: This example uses the “other service contract” MAF of 148

 Determine the required military-essential  positions IAW Chapter 3. 
  
 
3.a. 
 If all positions must be military, divide the total mhrs from Step 2 by the military MAF times the overload factor and round up.  This is the total requirement for the work center in scenario 1.  If all positions are not required to be military, go to Step 3.b. 
 Scenario 1 (all positions military essential): 
 
6935.49/(150.7 x 1.077) = 42.73military requirements 
 
3.b. 
 When there is a mix of military and civilian positions, multiply the military-essential positions by the appropriate MAF times the overload factor. 
 Scenario 2: 
 
26 military essential x (150.7 x 1.077) = 4219.8 mhrs 
 
4. 
 Compute total civilian mhrs.  Subtract mhrs obtained in Step 3.b. from total in-service mhrs computed in Step 2. 
    6935.49  Total in-service monthly mhrs 
 - 4219.8  Total military-essential mhrs 
   2715.69  Total civilian mhrs 
 
5. 
 Determine the required FN civilian positions.  Convert to FN mhrs by multiplying by the appropriate MAF (Table A3.2.).  Do not use any overload factor for FN civilians. 
 There are 8 FN civilian positions currently authorized and still required.  The United Kingdom 39-hour (nonindustrial) workweek MAF of 143.31 is used for this example. 
8 x 143.31 = 1146.48 FN monthly mhrs

6. 
 Compute the required USDH civilian mhrs.  Subtract any FN civilian mhrs obtained in Step 5 from total civilian mhrs obtained in Step 4.  If no FN civilian positions, use total civilian mhrs from Step 4. 
    2715.69  Total civilian mhrs 
 - 1146.48  Total FN civilian mhrs 
   1569.21  Total USDH civilian 
                                          mhrs 
 
6.a. 
 Determine USDH civilian positions when man-hours are 926.00 for CONUS, or 968.65 for overseas locations.  Divide the result of Step 6 by the product of the appropriate USDH civilian MAF (Table A3.1.) times the appropriate overload factor (Para 2.7.2.1.).  Round result to two decimal places and then round any fractional manpower up to the next whole number. 
 Computed mhrs exceed 968.65; go to Step 6.b. 
 
6.b. 
 Determine the required USDH civilian positions when man-hours are greater than 926.00 for CONUS or 968.25 for overseas locations (mhrs are equivalent to 6 USDH civilian positions for each respective MAF times the overload factor).  Divide total USDH civilian mhrs by appropriate MAF.  If the fractional manpower requirement is less than .5, round down to the next whole number.  If the fractional manpower is .5 or greater, round up to the next whole number (see note). 
 1569.21/149.9 = 10.46 = 10 USDH civilian requirements 
 
7. 
 Determine total requirements.  Sum requirements obtained in Steps 2, 3, 5 and 6.a. or 6.b.. 
 Scenario 1: 
     2  CFTE requirements 
   43  Military requirements 
   45  Total requirements 
 
Scenario 2: 
    2  CFTE requirements 
  26  Military requirements 
    8  FN civilian requirements 
  10  USDH civilian requirements 
  46  Total requirements 
 
Note:   The .5 rounding rule is inappropriate for work centers of six or less civilians because it could subject incumbents to overtime requirements exceeding the normal Air Force standard of 7.7 percent overload.  For example:  assume the result of Step 4 is 356 mhrs; 356/149.9 MAF = 2.37 and rounds down to 2 requirements.  The .37 manpower space or 55.46 mhrs is overtime work to be shared by the 2 incumbents and equates to an 18-percent overload factor (55.46/(149.9*2) = 18%). 
 

 
Attachment 5 
MANPOWER WORKFORCE MIX DECISION PROCESS 
A5.1.  Decision Process.  The following steps describe the decision process used to determine type of manpower (military, civilian, or contract service) to use when validating manpower requirements. See Figure A5.1 for a graphic illustration. 
Step 1.  Validated Manpower Requirement.  A validated manpower requirement is a unit of work, usually expressed in whole man-years that a MAJCOM manpower staff recognizes as a requirement for mission accomplishment.  After validating a manpower requirement, the MAJCOM goes to Step 2. 
  
Step 2.  Is Military Incumbency Required for Unit Mission? To answer this basic question, review Table A5.1., rules 1 through 11.  If the answer is yes, go to Step 3.  If the answer is no, go to Step 13. 
  
Step 3.  Is Full-time Capability Required? Decide whether the work must be performed during wartime only and need not be performed daily during peacetime.  If the answer is no, go to Step 4. If yes, go to Step 5. 
  
Step 4.  Provide Air Reserve Force Authorization.  Identify the workload requirement to AF/A1M so that it can give the proper ARC authorization.  
 
Step 5.  Are Active Military Skills Available?  Check AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), to determine whether proper AFSCs exist to perform the workload.  You may need to check with the MAJCOM personnel office and with AFPC/A1P to determine if military skills are available.  If yes, go to Step 6.  If no, go to Step 7.  
 
Step 6.  Provide Active Military Authorization.  The MAJCOM funds active military authorization.  
 
Step 7.  Is the workload appropriate for procurement by a contract?  Check the current Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR), Defense FAR, Air Force FAR, and other applicable DoD and Air Force guidance regarding applicability of the workload for contract.  (Examples include OMB Circulars and DoDI 1100.22.) 
  
Step 8.  Are Contract Services Available?  If the MAJCOM or installation contracting office determines that contract services are available, go to Step 9.  If not, go to Step 10. 
 
Step 9.  Use Interim Contract Until Resources Available.  The MAJCOM approves an interim contract until military resources can be planned and made available. 
 
Step 10.  Are Civilian Skills Available? The MAJCOM or local civilian personnel office determines whether civilian skills are available.  If no, go to Step 11. If yes, go to Step 12. 
 
Step 11.  Elevate to HAF.  The MAJCOM or local civilian personnel office recommends alternatives to HAF for resolution. 
 
Step 12.  Interim Use of Civilians Until Military Resources are Available.  The MAJCOM approves interim use of civilians until military resources can be planned and made available. 
 
Step 13.  Is Military Incumbency Required for Air Force-wide Mission?  Review Table A5.1., rules 9 through 13. If the answer is yes, go to Step 3.  If no, go to Step 14. 
 
Step 14.  Is In-Service Civilian Incumbent Required? Review Table A5.2., rules 1 through 9.  If yes, go to Step 15.  If no, go to Step 23. 
 
Step 15.  Are Civilian Skills Available?  See Step 10 for review procedures.  If yes, go to Step 16. If no, go to Step 17. 
 
Step 16.  Provide Civilian Authorization.  The MAJCOM gives civilian authorization. 
 
Step 17.  Are Active Military Skills Available?  See Step 5 for review procedures.  If yes, go to Step 18.  If no, go to Step 19. 
 
Step 18.  Interim Use of Military Until Resources Available.  The MAJCOM approves interim use of military personnel until civilian resources can be programmed and made available. 
 
Step 19.  Is There a Legally Contractible Workload? See Step 7 for procedures.  If no, go to Step 20. If yes, go to Step 21. 
 
Step 20.  Surface to HAF.  See Step 11. 
 
Step 21.  Are Contract Services Available?  See Step 8 for procedures.  If yes, go to Step 22.  If no, go to Step 20. 
 
Step 22.  Interim Contract Until Resources Become Available. See Step 9. 
 
Step 23.  Is There a Legally Contractible Workload? See Step 7.  If yes, go to Step 24.  If no, go to Step 27. 
 
Step 24.  Are Contract Services Available?  See Step 8. If yes, go to Step 25.  If no, go to Step 27. 
 
Step 25.  Are Contract Services Less Expensive?  When mission changes or wartime taskings dictate a review of a commercial activity, a cost comparison is appropriate.  To do the review, compare all relevant costs.  If yes, go to Step 26.  If no, go to Step 27. 
 
Contract prices. 
Other government costs. 
Transportation. 
Contract administration. 
Severance costs. 
Other costs. 
In-House Cost Elements. 
Civilian Personnel Costs. 
Materials, supplies, and equipment. 
Maintenance and repair. 
Installation overhead 
Factored costs. 
Retirement, life, health insurance. 
Federal taxes foregone. 
Interest for capital investment. 
Workmen‘s compensation and other benefits. 
Above installation overhead. 
Other costs. 
 
Step 26.  Procure Contract Services.  The contracting office procures contract services. 
 
Step 27.  Are Civilian Skills Available?  See Step 10 for procedures.  If yes, go to Step 28.  If no, go to Step 29. 
 
Step 28.  Are Civilian Authorizations Provided?  The MAJCOM gives civilian authorization. 
 
Step 29.  Are Military Skills Available? See Step 5 for procedures.  If yes, go to Step 30.  If no, go to Step 31. 
 
Step 30.  Interim Use of Military Until Resources Available.  The MAJCOM approves interim use of military personnel until civilian resources can be programmed and made available. 
 
Step 31.  Surface to HAF. Recommended alternatives must be surfaced to HAF for resolution.

A8.1.2.  Operations Concept.  Briefly describe the operational concept on how the system will be deployed and address the roles of both Active and Reserve units if differences exist.  Specifically state if the system will be used as a weapon against the enemy since this determination affects the combatant status of the operators.  The estimate specifies requirements for continuous operations and surge and describes environmental conditions or other factors that affect manpower determination.  (For instance, chemical, biological, nuclear, or extreme meteorological conditions require protective clothing, which impede performance and increase manpower.)  The MER identifies, by FY, echelon, manpower mix and DFC, the type and number of units or platforms (wings, squadrons, etc.) receiving the systems and the number of systems going to each type of unit or platform.  It identifies any unprogrammed force structure and plans to store systems in warehouses or temporarily place systems in training units if the plans affect the manpower.  Plans for the entire life of the system, to include the planned transfer of the system from the active to ARC shall be addressed.  The estimate will address whether, during a crisis or war, operational units will be located in areas where the risk of hostile fire or collateral damage is high, since these determinations affect manpower mix.

The estimate will identify maintenance support elements by echelon, manpower mix and DFC that are required during peacetime and war, to include in-theater depot support elements required during war.  It specifies if, during a crisis or war, any of the maintenance support elements will be located in areas where the risk of hostile fire or collateral damage is high.  Analysts verify whether equipment kept in storage require maintenance and if the workload is significant enough to require additional manpower.  The MER indicates whether the system requires a “core logistics capability” as defined in Title 10 United States Code, Section 2464.  Plans for the entire life of the system, to include the planned transfer of systems from the active to ARC must be addressed.  Plans for interim or life cycle contract support will be specified once the manpower mix has been determined.  It indicates if the contract services are “mission essential” as defined in DoDI 3020.37, Continuation of Essential DoD Contractor Services During Crises.  The estimate also addresses whether the maintenance concept represents a significant departure from how comparable contemporary systems are maintained.  The following are examples of comments that could be used to explain requirements. 
A8.1.3.1.  Base-level equipment maintenance performed at main operating bases. 
A8.1.3.2.  Maintenance at forward operating bases limited to equipment repair. 
A8.1.3.3.  Two-level maintenance concept employed to extent possible. 
A8.1.3.4.  A decision tree analysis or depot maintenance inter-service process used to determine depot-level maintenance source of repair. 
A8.1.4.  Support Concept.  The MER must address requirements for supply, repair parts distribution, security, BOS, life-cycle system management, warehousing, disposal, environmental clean-up and other support.  It identifies direct support elements by echelon, manpower mix and DFC that are required during peacetime and wartime over the life of the system.  Ratios may be used to estimate indirect support, to include BOS, disposal and environmental clean-up.  Unique transportation, intelligence mapping, charting and geodesy requirements and personnel security clearance requirements must be addressed if they require manpower increases.  The MER also addresses whether, during a crisis or war, support elements are located in areas where the risk of hostile fire or collateral damage is high.  Plans for interim or life-cycle contract support are specified once the manpower mix has been determined.  The MER indicates if the contract services are “mission essential” as defined in 
DoDI 3020.37.  It addresses plans for the entire life of the system, to include the planned transfer of systems from active to ARC.  The estimate will also address whether the support concept represents a significant departure from what is required by comparable contemporary systems. 
A8.1.5.  Training Concept.  The MER will briefly summarize the training concept and address the extent to which the system will rely on training devices, simulators, or embedded training.  This description covers unit, collective and joint training.  The MER identifies by FY, echelon, manpower mix  and DFC, the types and number of training activities (e.g., schoolhouse and training units) receiving the training systems and the number of systems going to each type of training activity.  It identifies training units that are assigned a training mission during peacetime but have operational missions during wartime.  Civilian training will be addressed if the workload is significant enough to require additional manpower.  Plans for interim or life cycle contract training will be specified once the manpower mix is determined.  The MER indicates if the contract services are “mission essential” as defined in DoD Instruction 3020.37.  Also, additional requirements that result from the planned transfer of systems from the active to ARC will be reported.  The MER shall address whether the training approach for the new system differs from training required for comparable contemporary systems.  Following are examples of comments that could be used to explain requirements. 
A8.1.5.1.  Instructional System Development analysis used to determine maintenance training requirements and equipment. 
A8.1.5.2.  Training conducted at technical training locations and field training detachments. 
A8.1.5.3.  Primary aircrew training conducted by an active duty training squadron with xx PAA. 
A8.1.5.4.  Contracted aircrew training system (simulator) operations and maintenance.

This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 38-2, Manpower.  This Air Force Instruction (AFI) applies to all Air Force units and organizations, the Air National Guard (ANG) and the Air Force Reserve (AFR) and provides guidance and procedures pertaining to the management of Air Force-directed additional duties.  The goals of this Instruction are to:  establish a gatekeeper process to assess Air Force and unit level additional duties; improve management of additional duties; and eliminate non-value-added additional duties.  To accomplish these goals this Instruction defines an additional duty, discusses the philosophy of how the Air Force uses and maintains control over additional duties, and establishes the decision flow process commanders/directors must use to document the value, priority, resources assigned and guidance for each additional duty.  In collaboration with the Director of the Air National Guard (NGB/CF) and the Chief of Air Force Reserve (AF/RE), the Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower, Personnel, and Services (AF/A1) develops HRM policy for Total Force Human Resource Management Governance.  This Air Force Instruction (AFI) may be supplemented at any level; all MAJCOM supplements must be approved by the HRM Strategic Board (HSB) prior to certification and approval.  Supplements (other than Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command) must be routed to Headquarters USAF Manpower, Organization and Resources, Manpower Requirements Division (AF/A1MR) for coordination prior to further staffing.  AFI content changes, related to ANG and AFRC, must be approved by the Director of the Air National Guard (NGB/CF) through the ANG Manpower, Organization, and Resources Division (NGB/A1M); or Air Force Reserve Command (AF/RE) through the Air Force Reserve Command Manpower, Organization 
and Resources Division (AFRC/A1M), respectively.  Requests for waivers must be submitted to the AF/A1MR for consideration and approval. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to AF/A1MR using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847 through channels to AF/A1MR, 1040 Air Force Pentagon Suite 5B349, Washington, DC 20330-1040 or e-mail: usaf.pentagon.af-a1.mbx.af-a1mr-workflow@mail.mil.  Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS).  The use of a name or mark of any specific manufacturer, commercial product, commodity, or service in this publication does not imply endorsement by the Air Force. 
SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
This publication has been revised and it is recommended it be thoroughly reviewed.  Major changes include the inclusion of Tier Waiver Authorities as outlined in AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, paragraph 1.9, and the addition of Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command guidance pertaining to the oversight and management of additional duties with the respective commands.   
1.  Overview. 
1.1.  Additional Duty Definition.  An Air Force-directed additional duty is a task required by federal law, executive order, and/or departmental publication and which is deemed external to the unit's primary mission/duties and not identified as direct or indirect workload.  This definition is further clarified to include tasks mandated by a HAF 2-letter and levied upon another HAF 2-letter and its subordinate units.  Tasks mandated by a HAF 2-letter that are required throughout a functional community are considered primary duties (i.e., direct workload). 
1.2.  The list of Air Force-directed additional duties is maintained on the Air Force Additional Duties Review – Saving Airmen’s Time SharePoint site; at https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AF-DP-00-70/default.aspx. 
1.3.  Management Philosophy. 
1.3.1.  Work force reductions and ever-expanding, complex and diverse missions require Air Force leaders, at every level, to re-evaluate their capabilities to achieve the balance between accomplishing the mission and not over stressing their people.  This guidance is intended to maximize unit effectiveness and eliminate those activities that unnecessarily drain resources. 
1.3.2.  All new additional duty proposals at the Air Force-level will be subject to a rigorous “gatekeeper” review.  The purpose of the review is to ensure only mission essential, AFI, or higher directive required additional duties are added. 
2.  Roles and Responsibilities. 
2.1.  AF/A1 (Gatekeeper): 
2.1.1.  AF/A1 is the Air Force Additional Duty "Gatekeeper" responsible for the overall process for approval, assignment and delegation of additional duties.  AF/A1 shall exercise those responsibilities with an emphasis on guidance, oversight, and liaison with the HAF components.  The AF/A1 is responsible for providing guidance, direction and oversight for all matters pertaining to the formulation, review and execution of plans, policies, programs and budgeting relative to: 
2.1.1.1.  Development and maintenance of an approved Air Force-directed Additional Duty List. 
2.1.1.2.  Manpower, budgeting and management of AF-directed additional duties to include the specific placement of additional duties in a functional area; all efforts will be made to improve the process to reduce the cost of additional duties. 
2.1.1.3.  Establishing guidance outlining the review process to assess new/revised Air Force-directed and unit-level additional duties. 
2.1.1.4.  Ensure manpower requirements are considered and proper coordination is obtained for each additional duty levied upon other organizations/functions by a HAF 2-letter.  In addition, consider manpower requirements to perform the additional duty in the overall manpower allocation for each unit. 
2.1.2.  The AF/A1 has the authority to convene a cross-functional council, as required, to review current or proposed Air Force-level additional duties. 
2.2.  AF/A1M will: 
2.2.1.  Serve as the Gatekeeper’s OPR for additional duties. 
2.2.2.  Establish a process to oversee new AF-directed additional duties.  The intent of the process is to ensure cross-functional activities are fully coordinated and agreed upon by the HAF functional leads. Review and coordination is done prior to publication of any new or revised Air Force directive (e.g., AFPD, AFI, AFMAN). 
2.2.3.  Make recommendation to AF/A1 to concur/non-concur with adding an additional duty to the Air Force-directed Additional Duty List. 
2.2.4.  Manage and update the master Air Force-directed Additional Duty List. 
2.2.5.  Determine if a HAF 2-letter request for a new or revised additional duty contains the appropriate rationale and justification to staff accordingly. 
2.3.  Air Force Personnel Center Manpower Directorate (AFPC/MA) responsibilities are to: 
2.3.1.  Maintain the Air Force-directed Additional Duty List. 
2.3.2.  Categorize and credit additional duty workload; i.e., whether the manpower credit for an approved additional duty should be included in applicable Air Force Manpower Standards (AFMS), or the Commanders Support Staff (CSS) manpower standard. 
2.3.3.  Update the appropriate factor and/or manpower standard as appropriate. 
2.3.4.  Review new and/or revised official directive Air Force publications for additional duties and identify the manpower impact to AF/A1M.  The review will address: 
2.3.4.1.  Does the proposal meet the definition of an additional duty? 
2.3.4.2.  Is the proposal a true new additional duty requirement? 
2.3.4.3.  Is the proposal a revision to a current approved additional duty? 
2.3.4.4.  Is the workload already accounted for in a manpower standard as direct workload? 
2.3.4.5.  Is the workload already credit in the CSS manpower standard? 
2.3.4.6.  Is the workload already accounted for in the applicable AFMS? 
2.3.4.7.  Has sufficient rationale/justification for the proposed additional duty been provided? 
2.3.4.8.  Does the manpower/resource impact estimate, and how it was computed, seem logical? 
2.3.4.9.  Do the estimated training requirements, and how they were computed, seem logical? 
2.3.4.10.  Does the estimate of required resources, and how they were computed, seem logical? 
2.3.4.11.  Have the AFPC/MA recommendations and comments been forward to AF/A1MR? 
2.3.4.12.  Have the recommendations and comments been forwarded to AF/A1 for approval? 
2.4.  NGB/A1M responsibilities: 
2.4.1.  Solely responsible for the accurate quantification of ANG full-time manpower requirements through the development, implementation and management of ANG Manpower Standards (MS). 
2.4.2.  Categorize and credit AFPC/MA-identified additional workload in the applicable ANG manpower standard to support ANG fulltime manpower requirements. 
2.4.3.  Establish a process to oversee new AF-directed additional duties for Guard units.  The intent of the process is to ensure cross-functional activities are fully coordinated and agreed upon by NGB/A1M, NGB/CF and HAF functional leads. Review and coordination is done prior to publication of any new or revised ANG directive. 
2.5.  AFRC/A1M responsibilities:  The AFR determines its own fulltime manpower requirements and will likewise categorize and credit identified additional workload using the AF Indirect Allowance Factors and AFR Common Reserve Support manpower standard to support AFR fulltime manpower requirements. 
2.6.  HAF 2-letters will: 
2.6.1.  Submit proposed new/revised additional duty workload to AF/A1 through AF/A1M workflow (afa1m.workflow@pentagon.af.mil), and ensure any new or revised publication (e.g., AFPD, AFI, AFMAN) adheres to the criteria established in this Instruction for review of a new or revised additional duty workload (Figure A2.1).  New/revised additional duty workload must be approved by AF/A1 before being 
incorporated into any new or revised directive.  Requests for new or revised additional duties must include: 
2.6.1.1.  Rationale justifying why a new additional duty is mandated. 
2.6.1.2.  Description of the entire additional duty task(s) in detail. 
2.6.1.3.  Scope of the additional duty; is it Air Force-wide, MAJCOM, or functionally specific, and what unit and organizational level will perform the additional duty. 
2.6.1.4.  Documented process improvement efforts incorporated to minimize the manpower impact to tasked organizations. 
2.6.1.5.  All Air Force publications, or directives, concerning the proposed additional duty, the HAF 2-letter plans to incorporate. 
2.6.1.6.  Estimated manpower impact (increase or decrease) the additional duty will have on each organizational level (i.e., man-hours per month) and how the impact was determined. 
2.6.1.7.  Required training requirements (time/frequency) and a description of how, and who, will conduct the training 
2.6.1.8.  Estimate of any other resources required (i.e., equipment, supplies, material). 
2.6.1.9.  Documentation that other HAF 2-letter(s) have coordinated/concurred with the new/revised additional duty when a cross-functional tasking impacts their resources/personnel. 
2.6.2.  Include appropriate documentation that AF/A1 has approved the new/revised additional duty as part of the publication process IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. 
2.6.3.  Periodically evaluate additional duties tasked to subordinate echelons to ensure they are valid and required; and conduct a review at least annually, or when a unit mission change occurs. 
2.7.  MAJCOM/FOA/DRU commanders/directors will: 
2.7.1.  Require their unit commanders/directors to periodically re-evaluate MAJCOM and locally directed additional duties to ensure there is ‘value added’ benefit to performing the duties at their location and whether there is mission impact. 
2.7.2.  Supplement this Instruction as needed, routing through AF/A1M, requests for clarification or implementation proposals specific to their command, and direct execution of additional duties not mandated by higher headquarters. 
2.7.3.  Require their subordinate staffs to periodically evaluate additional duties to ensure they are valid and required; and conduct a review at least annually, or when a unit mission change occurs. 
2.8.  Wing, group, squadron and other level commanders/directors will: 
2.8.1.  Execute the applicable Air Force-directed additional duties and locally-directed additional duties as deemed necessary based on mission needs, local conditions and resource availability.  (T-1). 
2.8.2.  Re-evaluate MAJCOM and locally-directed additional duties as applicable.  (T-1).  Commanders and directors must determine there is value added or benefit to performing these duties; and when there is nominal or a negative/debilitating impact to the unit and/or personnel they should consider elevating their concerns/issues to their MAJCOM functional counterpart for resolution.  (T-1). 
2.8.3.  When it is determined the performance of an additional duty is so significant (in terms of the man-hours expended) that it warrants consideration as an approved Air Force-directed additional duty, the unit commander, director, or designated representative, will submit a proposal to their respective MAJCOM counterpart, (T-1), that addresses the following points: 
2.8.3.1.  Identify and describe the additional duty. 
2.8.3.1.1.  What is the origin of the duty, or task and how does it affect unit mission and morale? 
2.8.3.2.  Is the task/duty mandated by an Air Force Instruction? 
2.8.3.3.  Has specific direction concerning the duty been provided by higher headquarters? 
2.8.3.4.  Is the duty unique to your base/unit? 
2.8.3.5.  What resources are required to perform the duty?  (Comment on:  manning to include skill level and training, time, money, facility, equipment, etc.). 
2.8.3.6.  Is there an impact if this duty is eliminated?  (Comment on:  positive, negative, or no effect on unit mission and morale)? 
2.8.3.7.  Is it a large duty that requires more than one person to accomplish in the unit? 
2.8.3.8.  Is it mission/time-critical enough to require assignment of a primary and alternate POC? 
2.8.3.9.  Is the duty valid for your unit?  If the duty is not valid, or appropriate for the unit, unit commanders/directors should consider elevating the concern(s) to the respective MAJCOM functional representative IAW paragraph 1.3.2. 
3.  Overall Additional Duty Review Process. 
3.1.  Air Force-Level Proposed Additional Duties. 
3.1.1.  Additional duties must be identified and described in an Air Force publication as defined in AFI 33-360.  In the event an additional duty appears to generate a manpower requirement, the sponsoring HAF 2-letter (OPR) will follow the steps in paragraph 2.6. of this Instruction by providing an estimated manpower impact as well as the other required information related to the value and cost of the additional duty requirement, along with a priority value of the new additional duty with respect to all other additional duties sponsored by the 2-letter. 
3.1.2.  Headquarters Air Force (HAF) 2-letters will use the Gatekeeper Additional Duty Review Process at Figure A2.1 to submit proposed additional duties.  Any new or revised publication, as identified in AFI 33-360 having a manpower impact (with respect 
to the man-hours required to perform the additional duties), must be identified by the OPR and coordinated with AF/A1M prior to publication.  HAF 2-letter (functional managers) are also responsible for appointing functional representatives to assist individuals in the development of standards and factors effected by the additional duty. 
3.2.  MAJCOM and Locally Proposed Additional Duties. 
3.2.1.  It is imperative unit commanders and directors understand the importance, value and intent of additional duties so they may place the appropriate emphasis on them.  (T-1).  It is important to note manpower will not be programmed for additional duty workload without Air Force or higher approval.  (T-1). 
3.2.2.  Documenting the Proposed Additional Duty.  Unit commanders and directors must document the proposed additional duty and ensure any impact and/or concern(s) resulting from the additional duty are identified and documented IAW paragraph 2.8.3.  (T-1).  This is to ensure unit members remain informed and ensures that individuals assigned to perform the task(s)/duties have the necessary training required to perform the task/duty. 
3.2.3.  Unit commanders/directors must periodically evaluate the performance of additional duties to determine if they are mandated and/or required.  (T-1).  Are there adequate resources to continue performance?  If a duty is not mandated, must it be performed or can it be consolidated with other similar tasks, or should it be subject to higher review?  Is it feasible to subdivide the duty between multiple units or locations?  The goal should be to minimize the impact upon the unit and personnel to the absolute extent possible by reducing the time and/or resources required.  (T-1).

3.8.6.1.  Monetary savings are calculated and reported based on first-year savings.  Exceptions may be made in cases where an improvement with a high implementation cost yields measurable savings continuing more than one year.  If implementation costs exceed 50 percent of first-year savings, calculations are based on average annual savings over a period of up to five years or the lifecycle of the improvement, whichever is less. 
3.8.6.2.  For ideas proposing an option(s) to satisfy a new mission requirement, do not use the cost difference between options to calculate/validate dollar savings. 
3.8.6.3.  Man-hour savings (even when associated with depot repair) may not be considered in calculation of dollar savings.  The only two exceptions are:  (1) a documented elimination of a manpower authorization (funded through the Future Years Defense Plan) from the Unit Manpower Document, and (2) elimination of documented overtime.  In those instances, the reductions are directly attributed to the suggested improvement.  Eliminated manpower positions are returned to the owning MAJCOM to be redistributed to higher priority workload that has been recognized, but not funded (an unfunded manpower position).  In those cases, use AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, to determine the annual cost of the manpower authorization and use that cost figure in savings calculation. 
3.9.  Servicing Manpower Office will: 
3.9.1.  Use CPI techniques, as needed, for idea submissions identified as problems versus implementable ideas (dialogue with commander/director regarding workload priorities may be warranted). 
3.9.2.  As requested, assist submitters with documentation of process improvement ideas, to ensure current method (current state), proposed method (future state), expected benefits, and cost of implementation (countermeasures) are fact-based proposals. 
3.9.3.  As requested, assists implementers with development of implementation plan. 
3.10.  Submitter (any Airman who submits an idea) will: 
3.10.1.  Work with a local CPI expert on validating and solving problems when the API Idea Cell determines the idea is a problem without a proposed method.  (T-2). 
3.10.2.  As requested by the API Idea Cell, provide additional information, to improve the quality of idea submission prior to evaluation, within 30 calendar days of request. 
3.10.3.  As requested by the evaluator, provide additional information to facilitate the evaluation of the idea by the suspense date established by the evaluator. 
3.10.4.  In the case of a group submission, positively identify members of the group in initial idea submission.  Group idea submissions are limited to five individuals.

AIRMEN POWERED BY INNOVATION IDEA PROCESS 
4.1.  Airmen Powered by Innovation Idea Process.  As depicted in figure 4.1, the API Idea Process is comprised of four phases:  Ideation/Submission Phase, Evaluation Phase, Implementation Phase, and Hold-the-Gains Phase.  The process is triggered by the submission of an idea from an Airman. 
Figure 4.1.  High Level API Idea Process Map. 
 

4.2.  Ideation Phase.  During the ideation phase, ideas are generated, reviewed, and improved to ensure fact rich ideas are forwarded for evaluation.  Additionally, during the ideation phase an idea is reviewed and the submitter is afforded a quality assist by the API Idea Cell.  The objective is to take a “seed” of an idea and transform it into a specific idea that has sufficient fact-based information to move to the evaluation phase. 
4.2.1.  Generating Ideas.  Ideas can be submitted at any time by any Airmen at the following website:  https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/site/API.  Additionally, ideas may be generated through crowdsourcing, a focused effort on a very specific problem or seed of an idea.  This method uses digital communications to leverage the creativity and experience of a large number of Airmen.  This method can be used not only prior to submitting an idea, but also after the API Idea Cell has returned the idea to the submitter requesting additional information to improve the quality of the idea submission prior to evaluation.  The method can also be used by an OLDM who has received an idea for evaluation, but determines more information needs to be gathered. 
4.2.1.1.  Initial Review.  The API Idea Cell reviews each idea submission and categorizes them in order to select an appropriate response to the submitter. 
4.2.1.1.1.  Specific idea.  The idea is valuable, practical, usable, clearly articulated, and ready to be evaluated with no additional work necessary.  The idea is ready to enter the evaluation phase. 
4.2.1.1.2.  Seed idea.  The idea is an interesting starter idea but not ready for evaluation.  The idea enters the quality assist activity wherein the API Idea Cell identifies additional information needed from the submitter prior to forwarding to an OLDM for evaluation. 
4.2.1.1.3.  After-the Fact Ideas.  An after-the-fact idea is an idea that has been presented formally or informally to management prior to submission to the API Program.  Management is defined as an individual who has the authority to pursue or give submitter approval to pursue the idea.  The idea needs to be submitted to the API Program within 90 working days of presentation of the idea.  The submission includes the date of presentation and to whom (name, duty title, telephone number, and e-mail address) it was submitted. 
4.2.1.1.4.  Commonly Received Ideas.  Ideas that address issues the Air Force is already cognizant of and/or is already addressing is to be closed after initial review.  Even though closed in the API system, these ideas may be analyzed by the appropriate headquarters subject matter experts to identify trends or improvement opportunities. 
4.2.1.1.5.  Ideas Governed by Policy External to the Air Force.  Ideas recommending improvements beyond the authority of the Air Force to approve and implement are closed after initial review.  Even though closed in the API system, these ideas may be analyzed by the appropriate headquarters subject matter experts to identify trends or improvement opportunities. 
4.2.1.1.6.  Non-actionable Ideas (personal complaint, personal attack, venting, etc.) - Submitter advised this process is not designed to respond to the nature of the submission. 
4.2.1.1.7.  Problem without a proposed solution - Submitter advised to resubmit with a proposed solution and to consider seeking out local CPI expert for assistance, as needed. 
4.2.1.1.8.  Uniform Change Request (UCR) - API cell will forward UCRs to Uniform Board POC (AF/A1SR) to determine whether UCR is to be presented to the next Uniform Board.  (T-1).  If AF/A1SR determines the idea is not going to meet the Uniform Board, they provide disapproval notice and rationale to the API Cell.  If they determine the idea is going to meet the Uniform Board, API Cell will hold those UCRs in a database until the next Uniform Board, at which time they compile and forward them to AF/A1SR.  After CSAF final decision, AF/A1SR will return the compiled list of UCRs to AFPC indicating each as approved/disapproved.  SAF/US(M) will accomplish monetary award payment requests for approved UCRs. 
4.2.1.1.9.  Patents/Inventions - Submitter advised that patents/inventions are no longer accepted in the API Idea Process and redirects them to AFI 51-303 Intellectual Property--Patents, Patent Related Matters, Trademarks and Copyrights. 
4.2.1.1.10.  Technical Order (T.O.) Changes - Submissions to make T.O. changes are not accepted in the API Program.  Airmen are redirected to Air Force Technical Order Guidance 00-5-1 to submit those types of change requests.  However, after an “improvement-type” T.O. change is adopted and implemented, Airmen may submit the completed AFTO Form 22 along with an excerpt from the published/updated T.O. for consideration in the API Program.  If the idea is a technical order change (already approved and implemented) OLDM is the wing-level authority for the technical content manager who approved the AFTO Form 22 proposing the improvement.  In this case, the OLDM is required to:  (1) confirm idea is a true process improvement vice improvement to the technical order, (2) confirm results (dollars/manpower /time/costs to implement) and (3) recommend award.  (T-1). 
4.2.1.1.11.  Price Challenge & Verification Program (formerly Zero Overpricing) - 
Price Challenges, in and of themselves, are not accepted in the API Program.  Airmen are redirected to AFI 23-101 Air Force Materiel Management to submit those types of change requests.  However, after a Price Challenge is adopted and implemented, Airmen may submit the supporting Defense Logistics Agency memorandum detailing the cost savings for consideration in the API Program.  
4.2.2.  Outcome.  The outcome of the Ideation Phase is an “evaluate-able” idea that increases the effectiveness and/or efficiency of the Air Force.  In other words, the present method, proposed method, expected benefits, and cost to implement are addressed in the idea. 
4.3.  Evaluation Phase. 
4.3.1.  Activity.  During the evaluation phase, the OLDM evaluates the idea through validation of the current method, proposed method, expected benefits, and cost of implementation. 
4.3.2.  Outcome.  There are three potential outcomes of the evaluation phase:  (1) approved or approved in part with intent to implement, (2) approved or approved in part without intent to implement, or (3) disapproved. 
4.3.3.  If an idea is approved with intent to implement, it then moves to the implementation phase. 
4.3.4.  If an idea is approved without intent to implement, the OLDM must provide rationale and identify constraints to implementation.  (T-2).  Approved ideas without intent to implement are reviewed and briefed during the quarterly performance review. 
4.3.5.  If an idea is disapproved, the OLDM must provide rationale or justification for the decision.  (T-2).  Disapproved ideas are reviewed and briefed during the quarterly performance review. 
4.3.6.  Evaluator disapproves the idea if it is already being considered or is already in use, but not as a result of the idea submission.  The API cell will provide feedback why the idea submission is disapproved via e-mail to the submitter. 
4.4.  Implementation Phase. 
4.4.1.  Activity.  During the implementation phase, implementation plans are developed and executed. 
4.4.2.  Outcome.  There are two potential outcomes of the implementation phase:  (1) the idea is fully implemented and results can be confirmed or, (2) a deliberate decision is made by the OLDM to suspend/cancel implementation. 
4.4.2.1.  If an idea is fully implemented, it moves to the hold-the-gains phase. 
4.4.2.2.  If an idea is suspended or canceled, the OLDM must provide supporting rationale for the action.  (T-2). 
4.5.  Hold-the-Gains Phase. 
4.5.1.  Activity.  During the hold-the-gains phase, the OLDM confirms results and where practical, sets a new standard of performance and measurement.  The API Cell will report confirmed savings (manpower and/or hard savings) to SAF/US(M) for harvesting through corporate planning, programming, budgeting and execution processes. 
Chapter 5 
AWARDS 
5.1.  Awards.  The Air Force uses non-monetary and monetary awards to recognize Airmen for successfully implemented ideas.  The maximum monetary award per idea is $10,000.  In the case of group submissions addressed in Paragraph 3.10.4., the amount is divided by the number in the group, and awarded to the eligible members of the group as defined in Paragraph 5.3.  Air National Guard Instruction 38-401, Suggestion Program establishes a program under which guard members may receive monetary awards. 
5.2.  All ideas approved or approved in part by the OLDM will receive a $100 monetary recognition award along with a personal letter from the approving OLDM.  Recognition awards will not exceed the maximum tangible award amount and will be subtracted from the potential award amount paid in accordance with confirmed savings for implemented ideas. 
5.3.  Ideas approved for implementation. 
5.3.1.  Local implementation - personal letter from OLDM 
5.3.2.  MAJCOM-wide implementation - personal letter from MAJCOM 2-Ltr 
5.3.3.  Air Force-wide implementation - personal letter from HAF 2-Ltr 
5.4.  Ideas that delivered confirmed results in effectiveness and/or efficiency when implemented. 
5.4.1.  An idea may have tangible benefits, intangible benefits or both.  Depending upon the nature of the idea, the OLDM may recommend a monetary award commensurate with both tangible/intangible benefits. 
5.4.1.1.   Tangible Results.  After an idea is implemented and tangible savings are calculated per paragraph 3.8.6 and confirmed by the OLDM, the submitter may receive an additional monetary award.  SAF/US(M) will use table 5.1. to determine the amount of the award.  SAF/US(M) is the final authority on determining all award amounts.  Award recommendations from the OLDM will be considered in SAF/US(M)’s final determination. 
5.4.1.2.  Intangible Results.  Intangible benefits are, out of necessity, estimated on the basis of subjective judgment rather than precise facts or calculations.  If benefits are intangible, the evaluator must clearly indicate the value and extent of application and recommend a precise award amount (Table 5.2.).  Suggestions with intangible benefits of limited value may be recognized.  (T-2). 
5.5.  Eligibility for awards.  Only members identified in paragraph 2.2 of this instruction are eligible for monetary awards. 
5.5.1.  Submitters are not eligible for monetary awards if: 
5.5.1.1.  Their assigned duty is to make recommendations for improvement on subject matter contained in their idea submission. 
5.5.1.2.  They are team members of a chartered process improvement event, conference, or special study where the idea was generated. 
5.5.1.3.  They can implement their idea without approval of higher authority. 
5.5.1.4.  Their submission is the original idea of another AF member, or is a result of ideas found in an open forum (e.g., blogs, Face Book, etc). 
5.5.1.5.  Their submission is a result of studies/research (including student papers) sponsored/paid for by the Government. 
5.6.  Processing awards.  Monetary awards are to be centrally funded at the HAF and managed by SAF/US(M). 
5.6.1.  The award payment process in this instruction only applies to ideas received on or after     1 June 2013. 
5.6.2.  Submitter’s commander determines eligibility using criteria above and provides input to SAF/US(M), before monetary award is made. 
5.7.  Award Payment Process Roles 
5.7.1.  SAF/US(M) PEM:. 
5.7.1.1.  Prepares SF 1034 (Public Voucher for Purchases and Services other than Personal).

This 20-year Strategic Master Plan advances the strategic vectors and imperatives set by America’s Air Force: A Call to the Future to provide a strategic framework that will shape the Air Force’s future. It provides consistent direction across all Air Force portfolios and brings year-to-year coherency to our plans and programs. However, the changes we need to enact are wider than just choices about equipment programs. Our Airmen are essential to all our capabilities and we must deliberately plan and invest in them to meet the challenges of the future. We must be more flexible in our posture at home and overseas. We must align our science and technology efforts with innovative concepts and capability development that will offer the opportunity to dominate in the future environment we envision and adapt rapidly when it changes. These aspects are covered in the four annexes to this plan, which provide actionable tasks to Air Force commands and agencies.

The Strategic Master Plan does not stand alone. It is at the center of a fully revised Air Force Strategy, Planning and Programming Process, which enables us to make strategy-informed resource decisions. Programmers and planners at Air Force Headquarters and Major Commands are the primary audience for this document. The Strategic Master Plan fills a void in strategic direction and will reduce the need for many existing strategic plans currently issued by various headquarters and organizations. It will be complemented by an Air Force Future Operating Concept document that will describe how we will deliver Global Vigilance, Global Reach and Global Power in agile and innovative ways – appropriate for the future we face. 
These documents certainly do not reflect the sum total of all strategic planning efforts across our Air Force. There are significant planning documents created by the functional staffs, MAJCOMs, and Core Function Leads that are critical to form a comprehensive plan. It is imperative, however, that these Core Function Support Plans and Flight Plans are consistent with the direction in this plan. 
Finally, bear in mind that this plan is long-term and iterative, and will be updated regularly. We need your help to improve and refine the plan as conditions and priorities dictate. We must apply discipline and adjust to the world around us; only through your efforts can this plan succeed.

Executive Summary 
This Strategic Master Plan (SMP) translates the United States Air Force’s 30-year strategy, America’s Air Force: A Call to the Future, into comprehensive guidance, goals, and objectives. The complete SMP consists of a core narrative, goals, objectives, and four annexes: the Human Capital Annex (HCA), Strategic Posture Annex (SPA), Capabilities Annex (CA), and the Science and Technology Annex (STA). The core SMP will be updated every two years, while the annexes may be revised annually, as required.  
The SMP’s primary audience includes the Headquarters Air Force (HAF) staff, the Air Force Major Commands (MAJCOMs), and the Core Function Leads (CFLs) that reside within the MAJCOMs who are responsible for planning, programming and budgeting. However, guidance in the SMP also serves as authoritative direction for all Air Force programs and Flight Plans.  
The SMP aligns long-range Air Force strategy, policy, and guidance with planning and programmatic decisions of senior Air Force leadership in support of National Defense and Combatant Command requirements. It does this by prescribing broad goals and objectives that help guide development of plans throughout the Strategy, Planning, and Programming Process (SP3) and associated inputs to the Joint Capabilities Integration Decision System (JCIDS) and Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) systems. As described in the Air Force Strategy, the Air Force must aggressively pursue a path that leads to the institutional strategic agility required to adapt and respond faster than our adversaries in an increasingly dynamic environment characterized by constrained resources. Although the core SMP does not specify priorities for investment or divestment, its imperatives and vectors provide shared understanding that empowers Air Force senior leaders to align interests and reach consensus in the face of difficult planning choices. The priorities expressed in the four annexes provide a framework to guide HAF, MAJCOM, and CFL staffs as they build balanced options for the Air Force within the SP3. 
The Air Force will increase Agility by strengthening our culture of adaptability and innovation in Airman development and education, capability development, operational training and employment, and organizations. To increase our Inclusiveness, we must focus on empowering the members of the Air Force Team, improving the structure and culture that populates it, and expanding our connections both outside and within the Service.  
The Air Force Strategy’s five strategic vectors identify priority areas for investment, institutional change, and operational concepts: 
1. Provide Effective 21st-Century Deterrence: The nuclear mission remains the clear priority of Air Force leaders, but the Air Force also offers many additional capabilities to deter a wide range of actors. 

2. Maintain a Robust and Flexible Global Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Capability: The Air Force will employ agile multi-domain solutions to detect, characterize, deter, and defeat adversaries. This requires an agile, coordinated multi-domain ISR approach that provides commanders with multiple options.  

3. Ensure a Full-Spectrum Capable, High-End Focused Force: The Air Force must focus on the skills and capabilities that deliver freedom of maneuver and allow decisive action in highly-contested spaces. However, we must retain the ability to succeed in low-intensity conflict. 


4. Pursue a Multi-Domain Approach to our Five Core Missions: To achieve the most effective solutions across the spectrum of military operations, we will increasingly integrate and employ capabilities operating in or through the cyberspace and space domains in addition to air capabilities. 

5. Continue the Pursuit of Game-Changing Technologies: We must continue to pursue radical improvements in technology, that when combined with new approaches and organizational changes, expand or maintain asymmetric advantages over adversaries. This requires the identification and harvesting of potential breakthroughs in thinking that might amplify the enduring effects that underpin our advantages in air, space, and cyberspace. 


By establishing a core strategic approach that spans the Air Force, the SMP represents a significant shift in the way the Air Force conducts its business. As subsequent iterations of the SMP inform—and are informed by—annual Planning Choices events and ongoing Service-wide activities to organize, train, and equip the Service, the structure and content of this document will evolve to best articulate the Air Force’s long-range strategic plan.

Introduction 
Background and Purpose 
In the 2014 Air Force Strategy, entitled America’s Air Force: A Call to the Future, the United States Air Force outlines its 30-year strategy to address a future environment characterized by uncertainty and change. The following Strategic Master Plan (SMP) operationalizes the Air Force Strategy by providing authoritative direction that informs Service-wide planning and prioritization on a 20-year timeline.  
The 2014 Air Force Strategic Environment Assessment (AFSEA) identified four areas where emergent threats to our current world model are likely to provoke profound and rapid change over the next 20 years:   
. Geopolitics 

. Natural resources 

. Challenges to the Global Commons 

. Speed of technological change 


To provide for a robust national defense and field suitable capability and capacity in support of joint operations, the Air Force will pursue systems, concepts, people, and organizational structures that are more agile and inclusive. The Air Force Strategy addresses this need by expounding these two strategic imperatives to drive a culture change. To focus our efforts in making tough choices about future capabilities, the Strategy further identifies five strategic vectors. These vectors will guide investments, institutional changes, employment concepts, and ultimately shape efforts to deliver national security through the strength of our Airmen and the responsive and effective application of Global Vigilance-Global Reach-Global Power for America. 
The SMP focuses largely on elements of change in the organization, training, and equipping of the Air Force. This focus should not discount or diminish many of the successful ongoing efforts of today’s Airmen or the incremental improvements already underway such as Air Force 2023, which remains in effect. The direction in the SMP provides the basis for determining what we should continue doing and what we should change, but informed collaboration will be the true driving force behind our efforts. 
The following sections explain the intent of the SMP, its internal structure (see Figure 1), and its position within the hierarchy of the Strategy, Planning, and Programming Process (SP3) (see Figure 2). The three main purposes of the SMP are to: 
. Translate the Air Force Strategy’s Imperatives and Vectors into capability development and planning direction. The SMP discusses each Imperative and Vector in detail, and defines supporting goals and objectives. While the broad goals and objectives defined in the SMP will be a key factor in subsequent prioritization decisions, they themselves are not prioritized because they are inherently interdependent and are all essential to achieve the Air Force Strategy. Initial prioritization will be described in the SMP annexes and subordinate documents, particularly Core Function Support Plans (CFSPs) and Flight Plans, but prioritization will not be complete until the periodic Planning Choices event (see definitions and Figure 2 below). 

. Align activities across the Air Force. Subordinate plans must aim to achieve the SMP objectives, and may include subordinate objectives and tasks as appropriate. Core Function Leads 


(CFLs) are formally directed to comply with the SMP through the SP3. MAJCOMs and other agencies will ensure their plans are consistent with the SMP. 

. Provide a mechanism to track progress against the Air Force Strategy. Headquarters Air Force (HAF) A5/8 will measure progress against the Air Force Strategy using the objectives in the SMP. 


Scope and Structure of the Strategic Master Plan  
The SMP is directly below the Air Force Strategy in precedence and includes four annexes. Each annex focuses on a foundational element of the Air Force Strategy, which relates broadly to people, places, things, and the future. The annexes translate the SMP’s comprehensive goals and objectives into tangible actions and priorities. The four annexes are as follows: 
. Human Capital Annex (HCA). The Human Capital Annex will be the principal driver behind the changes we seek in our Air Force. It sets the conditions for a much more agile and inclusive Air Force by providing strategic-level guidance on accessions, professional development, retention, and organization of our Airmen.  

. Strategic Posture Annex (SPA). The Strategic Posture Annex provides direction on where and how the Air Force will pursue the mid- and far-term development of stateside and overseas basing priorities to support the steady state and rotational forces. The Air Force’s strategic posture is managed by assessing force requirements against the Strategy and ensuring adequate footprint and agreements are in place to support critical military operations.  

. Capabilities Annex (CA). The Capabilities Annex describes Air Force core capabilities, capability gaps, and capability development priorities over time. The annual Strategic Planning Guidance refines CA priorities, as fiscal realities are factored into the SP3.  

. Science and Technology Annex (STA). The STA guides the Air Force’s Science and Technology (S&T) portfolio in two ways. First, it looks at technology evolution to address existing capability needs. Second, it addresses potentially revolutionary technologies that, while not mature, have the potential to be game-changing.  


 
Figure 1: Internal Structure of the SMP 
Through the HCA, SPA, CA, and STA, the SMP consolidates and transmits strategic direction to staffs preparing Strategic Planning Guidance, Core Function Support Plans, and Flight Plans: 
. Strategic Planning Guidance (SPG). The annual SPG provides strategic fiscal and force structure guidance to Core Function Leads and MAJCOMs.  

. Core Function Support Plans (CFSPs). The SMP and SPG provide direction for the CFSPs. CFSPs provide proposals approved by CFLs for organizing, training, and equipping (OT&E)  assigned Service Core Functions. These proposals are created under various risk and resource constraints defined in the SPG. They provide a description of the Core Function’s capabilities and an analytically-based, prioritized list of gaps in those capabilities based on time, scenario, and risk to mission and force. CFSP narratives provide the analytic basis for their accompanying capability gap assessments and Planning Choice Proposals (PCPs). 

. Flight Plans. All top-level plans that inform resourcing decisions (other than CFSPs), such as MAJCOM plans or functional plans by Deputy Chiefs of Staff are referred to as Flight Plans. Flight Plans do not specifically need to address SMP objectives, but must be aligned with the Strategy and SMP. Flight Plans may be used to achieve alignment across functional areas, 


influence resourcing decisions, provide informative inputs to CFSPs, or direct discrete (i.e. non-CFL-related) activities. Flight Plans may also be used to develop PCPs.1 

. Planning Choices Event. Air Force senior leaders meet annually to convene a Planning Choices Event, where they incorporate and adapt CFSP PCPs into options for investment and divestment in accordance with the SMP/SPG priorities. The result is a 20-year Resource Allocation Plan including a 10-year Balanced Budget. This becomes the basis for Program Planning Guidance, which provides strategy-informed, capability-driven, and resource-balanced instructions for the Air Force Program Objective Memorandum (POM).

Assessment and Revision 
The SMP is an iterative document and will be revised every two years based on progress against the enduring Air Force Strategy and as higher-level defense strategy and guidance evolves. However, this initial version may be revised earlier. Regular assessments will evaluate compliance and consistency as well as measure progress toward meeting the goals and objectives in the Strategy. 
Any suggestions for improving the SMP are welcome and should be forwarded to AF/A5SS as they arise to ensure this plan remains agile and useful. 
Assumptions  
Developing a strategy requires certain assumptions about a future state. In order to manage accuracy and relevance, these assumptions are clearly explained to permit periodic review and update.  
. Responsibilities. The Air Force will remain responsible to the nation for organizing, training, equipping, and providing disciplined forces to deliver responsive and effective Global Vigilance, Global Reach, and Global Power through our five core missions, which may evolve over the next 20 years (as they have done since 1947). 

. Posture. The Asia and Pacific Area of Responsibility (AOR) will be a region of increased national emphasis. However, the United States will continue to rely on the Air Force’s ability to provide rapid, effective forward presence anywhere around the world.  

. Demand. Combatant Command missions and requirements will exceed the Air Force’s capacity to meet them. 

. Resourcing. We can expect reduced funding levels, with further reductions in the near-term and no more than moderate increases in the mid- to far-term.  

. Total Force. The Air Force as an institution will remain fundamentally committed to the Total Force, with a multi-component approach throughout the SP3. 


Risk 
Strategic agility hinges on the ability to negotiate risks associated with change and avoid the risks connected to stagnation. Risk is a function of uncertainty quantified by probability, exposure, likely consequences, and cost; however, uncertainty and chance are integral elements of warfare that cannot be eliminated. The Air Force must avoid defaulting to the safest course, and prudently accept risk in order to yield new opportunities. Strategic Choices and related decisions must be based on robust risk assessments conducted under various resource constraints and against approved scenarios. Development of a common risk framework will allow CFL risks and detailed understanding of the available trade space to be integrated at the HAF in preparation for Planning Choices events.  
Terms and Definitions 
 For the purposes of this document, the following apply: 
. Goal: An expression of the desired future state of the Air Force in a particular area or theme. Goals define and prioritize broad direction, and are inherently long-term in nature. 

. Objective: A major milestone or action required to achieve a goal.  


o SMP objectives adhere as far as possible to the SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound) model. However, some may need further development as the plan matures. 

o Objectives in the SMP annexes are subordinate to the SMP goals and objectives. More than one annex will often contribute to achieving an SMP objective. For example, introduction of a new capability may have human capital and posture implications. 

o Most SMP objectives link directly to one or more annexes, but some also include additional action or involvement from other agents not covered by the CA, HCA, SPA or STA. The “Other” category in the tables and graphics depicts these links. 

o CFSPs and Flight Plans may have their own subordinate objectives. 


. Contributing Objective. An objective may contribute to achieving more than one goal. Such an objective is listed under the primary goal, and as a contributing objective under any other goals on which it acts (see Figure 4). 

. Time Factors: Objectives are classified as near-term, mid-term or far-term based on when they need to be completed. Activity contributing to the objective may need to begin much earlier (in most cases in the near term), and, in the case of a steady-state objective, activity may continue beyond its achievement.  

o Near: 0-5 years, or within the current Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). 

o Mid: 6-10 years. 

o Far: beyond 10 years. 


. Objective Naming Convention: Objectives are prefixed by the 3-digit code for the goal to which they primarily contribute, and then numbered sequentially, such as AG1.2. Objectives are then assigned to the applicable annexes for action as indicated in the tables of goals and objectives. In each of the SMP annexes, sub-objectives are prefixed by the code for the goal and SMP objective, and then identified by H, P, C, or S for objectives in the HCA, SPA, CA and STA respectively; see Figure 3 below: 


 
Figure 3: Objective Naming Convention 
Strategic Imperatives 
The Air Force Strategy identifies two strategic imperatives that underpin a fundamental change in the nature of the Service: Agility (AG) and Inclusiveness (IN).  
IMPERATIVE: AGILITY 
Section Overview. The Agility we seek will enable the Air Force to adapt our capabilities and thinking to assess a dynamic threat environment, outmaneuver adversaries, and support our partners. Our strategy expresses an iterative approach, balancing desired capabilities with available resources within an evolving strategic context. The Air Force will enhance agility by strengthening our culture of adaptability and innovation by long-term investments in: 
     .    Airman Development and Education, specifically related to recruiting and new options for service, retention, and education. 
     .    Capability Development, emphasizing agility through modularity, system integration, acquisition agility, and increased experimentation. 
     .    Operational Training and Employment through new and affordable approaches to training, modeling and simulation, and command and control. 
     .    Adaptive Organizations through new and more agile structures and processes. 
Development and Education 
An agile Air Force requires agile Airmen. We must adapt our recruiting, development, and retention processes to grow such Airmen. 
. Recruit cutting-edge talent. Mission-critical qualities are evolving. A complex future demands a new generation of Airmen with a diverse blend of talent suitable for that environment. The Air Force must increasingly develop Airmen with abilities that can exploit the emerging globalized, information-based, and networked environment rather than the industrial processes of the last century. These desired skills influence operations in all domains and across all core missions. The Air Force will devote increased resources and attention to nontraditional venues (one example is the CyberPatriot2 competition). Those who answer the call to serve will join an agile team that cultivates their skills and values their contributions to operational success in the multi-domain complexity of highly contested environments. 

. Provide a range of options for service. Many Airmen will continue to follow traditional career tracks that hone perishable skills in mission-critical fields. However, we will also broaden the options available to pursue agile developmental paths. The Air Force will explore increased opportunities for Airmen to transition back and forth between active duty, Guard and Reserve 


2 www.uscyberpatriot.org   
service. In addition, Airmen should be able to pursue opportunities with organizations across the Department of Defense (DoD) or outside it with a subsequent return to uniformed service. Individuals with broad experience along a continuum of service will complement those with concentrated expertise in specific mission sets. The result will be a more diverse team of innovators who will sustain the Air Force with a steady influx of new ideas and informed judgment, allowing us to adapt and operate more responsively than our adversaries. 

. Retain our expert warriors. Airmen serving today have spent years fighting alongside joint, interagency, and allied partners. They represent a significant investment by the Air Force. We must preserve our ability to integrate and collaborate across the full spectrum of operations, and that means retaining the experience and judgment of our veteran warriors even as we recruit new minds. The Air Force will retain its top talent by providing Airmen and their families with better incentives that go beyond simple financial rewards. As we become a lighter, leaner force, taking care of Airmen and families must remain an Air Force priority. 

. Unlock capacity for comprehensive education. The Air Force will develop Airmen who are critical and creative thinkers by implementing an agile, individually tailored approach to life-long education, and eliminating superfluous demands from already encumbered schedules. However, while we will support learning with appropriate technology such as computer-based training, we will not lose the mentorship inherent in the instructor-student relationship.  


Capability Development  
The Air Force needs capability options to execute missions in support of national defense and joint and combined operations under a wide array of contingencies. These capabilities must be responsive to changing needs. They must be affordable and adaptable enough to be modified easily or divested when no longer mission effective. They must be able to integrate seamlessly with other assets. The capability development process itself must also become more responsive, adaptable, and agile. The increasing rate of change of today’s technologies and security environment is fundamentally at odds with a decades-long capability development process that often fields cumbersome, inflexible, and expensive systems. Therefore, we must: 
 
. Pursue modular, adaptable, and upgradeable solutions. A modular approach to capability development will mitigate and distribute risk across a wider range of providers. We will embrace “agile acquisition” techniques and focus on risk reduction through production prototyping and new engineering development models. Future systems will include air and space frames, power plants, sensors, processors, multi-domain communication pathways, and armaments that are compatible, interchangeable, resilient, and suitable for diverse, multi-domain missions and force compositions that may not have been apparent at the outset of a program. This includes designing prudent Human Systems Integration (HSI) early in the systems engineering process.  Modular and interoperable systems developed through an Open Systems Architecture (OSA) using components with well-defined functions and interfaces will reduce costs and shorten the acquisition timeline. The Air Force will examine all capability requirements against existing joint capabilities with an eye toward adopting shared solutions, even if that adoption requires changing Air Force operational concepts. 

. The Air Force will act as integrator at both the platform and enterprise level, and will define technical standards and common architectures that will ensure our capabilities are integrated and 


interoperable with weapon systems in other domains and with those of our partners. While this approach to systems integration will require investment in both organization and people, it will lower the cost of failure and inspire creative risk-taking. Modularity will allow platforms to receive timely upgrades that amplify and extend their usefulness as both environments and adversaries evolve. OSA also provides maximum flexibility in designing a “system of systems” to provide unique capabilities. We will also examine innovative ways to use mature systems for a greater variety of circumstances and environments. 

. Empower the Air Force as a customer. An agile Service demands an agile acquisition enterprise that can balance capabilities, time, and costs. The Air Force will strengthen the acquisition workforce through enhanced training, education, and recognition. We will improve business acumen in the acquisition workforce, competitively hiring professionals externally where necessary. This cadre of cross-functional professionals will collaborate effectively with operators and requirements experts to deliver agile, innovative, adaptable, and affordable capabilities. In conjunction with senior Air Force and DoD leaders, they will work with Congress to improve acquisition processes and identify and change or eliminate the practices and bureaucracies that hinder the delivery of warfighter capabilities. Additionally, the Air Force will aim to own system technical baselines wherever possible to improve program performance. 

. Incentivize innovative, competitive solutions. The Air Force will invigorate the extraordinary talent resident in America’s industrial, commercial, and academic sectors by increasing communication, healthy competition, and transparency. The Air Force will conduct prototyping, experimentation, and development planning, to include systems engineering, to formulate and evaluate viable concepts, identify technology shortfalls, and assist in refining requirements. In addition to current research and development efforts, the Air Force will invest seed money into competitions, studies, and demonstrations that galvanize the S&T community to apply their creativity and resources to solve complex problems.3 These modest investments will allow the Air Force to determine quickly the viability of potential pathways forward. 

. Inject Pivot Points to assist acquisition agility. The Air Force will ensure that the requirements and acquisition processes include opportunities for programs to change the direction they are headed based on developments in technology, demonstration of new concepts, or budget issues. Properly implemented, these “pivot points” will provide an opportunity to make cost and capability trades across, as well as within, programs. They will create opportunities to augment, adjust, or sever components of systems without derailing development planning, generating cost overruns, or crippling our industry partners. They also create opportunities for inserting new technologies into existing programs. Increased capability in the acquisition enterprise will enhance our ability to control lifecycle costs and reliably deliver timely, suitable solutions to the warfighter. 

. Use experimentation for agile capability development. Meeting the challenge articulated in the Air Force Strategy necessitates a more integrated, agile capability development framework and a

renewed commitment to fostering innovation enabled by development planning, science and technology, and robust experimentation campaigns. Experimentation is a tool to transform innovative ideas, concepts, and technologies into demonstrated warfighting capabilities. It provides a means for multi-disciplinary teams of operators, researchers, and acquirers to conceive and co-evolve new system concepts with the doctrine to implement them effectively. Experimentation will also examine innovative and unconstrained methods of employing existing systems in a variety of circumstances and environments to provide potentially entirely new capabilities. In concert with development planning, experimentation will evaluate “system of systems” or “family of systems” concepts and multi-domain approaches resulting in mature concepts; concepts of operations (CONOPs); tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs); and enabling technologies that inform Air Force strategic decisions. 


Operational Training and Employment 
Although the Air Force faces an extended period of drastically constrained resources, the imperative to train and employ combat power with agility and resolve remains paramount. Airmen will rise to these challenges when they receive the trust, training, and doctrinal flexibility needed to improve and innovate. 
. Mutual trust and delegation. Airmen exemplify initiative and prudent risk-taking when their commanders trust their judgment and empower them to act boldly. This mindset must permeate our operations. To empower innovative Airmen at all levels, Air Force leaders will establish and uphold a Service-wide climate of mutual trust. We will review our promotion and assignment systems to ensure time-in-grade and milestone-based qualifications for advancement do not stifle initiative and innovation to develop these Airmen and leaders.  

. Initial Skills Training (IST). IST must keep pace with both Air Force requirements and technology. When technology and cyber threats are changing at a geometric rate, we cannot wait 18-24 months for our school houses to update curriculum. Iterative curriculum updates and incorporation of a rapid feedback loop from the field (supervisors, commanders and MAJCOM Functional Managers) is the way we will overcome the gap between current day IST and the skills needed in the field.  

. Comprehensive, integrated training. Training for full-spectrum operations has suffered during recent operations when our focus was, rightly, on a particular part of the range of military operations. Despite the prospect that the demands on our force will change, keeping our Airmen trained and ready for full-spectrum conflict will remain a challenge. The Air Force will pursue creative approaches to combine training across multiple mission sets, to cultivate Airmen who are not only experts of their own crafts but are also cognizant of complementary capabilities. 

. Advanced Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) training. Future training and exercises will integrate LVC venues to enable the Air Force to develop and evaluate realistic, multi-domain approaches to complex and emergent challenges. Training will emphasize disciplined initiative, prudent risk-taking, and comprehensive problem solving against agile adversaries in uncertain, contested environments. 

. Experimentation enabled by Modeling and Simulation (M&S). Distinct from training, our most experienced operators must be able to experiment with concepts and TTPs in a robust M&S environment. While not training in a pure sense, this is an operator-driven activity that establishes a firm feedback loop into the Capability Development process. 


. Agile, integrated command, control, and employment. The Air Force will lead the high-end fight even as it remains a crucial component of unified action across the spectrum of military operations. Accordingly, we will build and maintain common standards and architectures for command and control (C2) and communications with our joint, interagency, and international partners. This progress involves acknowledging that distinct contingencies demand different methods of multi-domain C2. We will evolve Air Force C2 doctrine to include variable models of centralization and decentralization, organization, and execution. We will preserve the lessons learned from decades of combat by maintaining robust relationships with our partners. Frank interactions, more frequent exchanges, and unified training will cement these bonds and enhance our agility. 

. Cost-conscious mindset. The requirements and challenges of the future will be faced within an enduring fiscally constrained environment. Airmen must balance operational readiness and risk within a cost-conscious mindset that supports the utilization of resources toward maximum operational effectiveness. This mindset is particularly important in the development and use of technologies and techniques to optimize energy usage and efficiency across our missions in air, space, and cyberspace. 


Agile Organizations 
Risk of failure is a necessary condition for true innovation, and agile organizations maintain the flexibility to adapt and adjust their approaches and structures in response. Institutional entrenchment in the form of deep hierarchy, overregulation, massive coordination requirements, and an erroneous attachment to “the way we’ve always done it” can stifle progress. The Air Force will foster organizations that can responsibly learn from minor setbacks in pursuit of major achievements. 
. Accelerate Institutional Feedback Loops. Mutual trust is the foundation of agile, successful organizations because it allows for constructive communication. The Air Force will improve its organizational structure by accelerating feedback loops vertically within the chain of command and laterally across organizations. Commanders must empower Airmen to modify counterproductive practices promptly and to share innovations laterally. 

. Enable Emergent Networks of Experts. Technology provides numerous means to create and encourage collaboration in an era of constrained resources. The Air Force will leverage advanced telecommunications and integrated LVC venues to allow Airmen of all disciplines to collaborate with each other and our joint, interagency, and international partners. Flexible, self-organizing networks of subject matter experts will be fertile grounds for advances that are currently inconceivable. 

. Flatter, More Agile Organizations. The Air Force needs to be able to push decisions and execution to the lowest informed level. Discipline and the unbroken chain of command will remain fundamental elements of the profession of arms. However, in the future, organizations with distributed decision-making and execution authority will be optimally poised to engage emergent obstacles and threats. To leverage a diversity of backgrounds, experiences, and perceptions, Air Force leaders at all levels must be trained and empowered to build their own teams, using a decentralized personnel assignment authority within responsible constraints, and to create a culture of inclusiveness. 


. Renovate Organizational Processes and Structures.  We will train Airmen to be skilled practitioners of process improvement and organizational techniques that maximize productivity and efficiency while inculcating a philosophy of continual improvement within the service culture.4 Airmen will be encouraged to bring forth ideas at every level of leadership for potential implementation. Air Force units at every echelon will continually analyze and implement approaches to eliminate redundant oversight and duties that encumber Airmen and stifle productivity. This will result in fewer additional duties, fewer formal meetings, simplified staff coordination, and tailored approaches to reporting and accountability that are not “one-size-fits-all.” The Air Force organizational structures at every echelon will be routinely updated to reflect optimal alternatives that emerge from implemented process changes.

IMPERATIVE: INCLUSIVENESS 
Section Overview. The complex strategic environment demands a diverse team of people to overcome its challenges and exploit its opportunities. Inclusiveness ensures that we are leveraging the broadest possible set of human resources to produce the maximum number of options. In this way, inclusiveness serves as the power underwriting our agility. We will focus on three areas:  
     .    Improving the structure of the Air Force Team, in particular the organization and employment of all elements of the Total Force. 
     .    Evolving the culture of the Air Force by enhancing diversity of thought in both whom we recruit and how we employ them, and by ensuring an environment of dignity and respect throughout the Service.  
     .    Strengthening partnerships both within and outside the Air Force, to include our relationship with Congress, think tanks and academia, industry, the joint and interagency team, and our allies and international partners. 
Structure of the Air Force Team 
The Active, Guard, Reserve, and civilian components of the Total Force each offer unique capabilities and strengths. To maximize the utility of the Total Force, we need people who are adept at finding creative ways to leverage and optimize the force structure to meet mission demands, within a system that is responsive to their needs. Air Force leaders versed in the unique benefits and capabilities of each component and able to utilize them for the good of the joint mission will be invaluable assets to the joint force and the Nation. 
. We will create a generation of senior leaders with cross-component experience who understand the intricacies of both Active and Reserve Components and can leverage that experience to find innovative solutions for a specific situation in a complex and dynamic future. The Air Force should ensure high-potential candidates have the opportunity to undertake assignments with other components and recognize the value of this experience. 

. To translate these leaders’ ideas into reality, we must ensure our force structure is flexible enough to respond. We must further blur the lines between the components where appropriate, while retaining their strengths. In addition to current associate unit models, we must identify additional opportunities for integration between Active and Reserve Components. We will continually assess our mission allocation to each component, aligning to each component’s strengths as appropriate and being mindful of reversibility, in order to both harmonize and optimize the Total Force. We must also adapt our personnel system to allow members to flow between Active, Guard, and Reserve Components and back over the course of their careers to provide career flexibility and broaden opportunities.  

. We will conduct a comprehensive review of the existing legal and policy framework governing the operational use of the Air Reserve Components (ARC) and utilization of individuals, to identify the major friction points in the system and methodically engage the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the National Guard Bureau, state leaders, and Congress to eliminate 


barriers. The Total Force may benefit from a large-scale reform akin to the impact of the Goldwater-Nichols Act on joint operations. 


Operational Utilization of the ARC 
. We need to capitalize on the evolution of the last several decades. Our foundational assumption on the use of the ARC has shifted from a strategic reserve augmenting active capacity to a force that is fully engaged and organized in operationally indistinguishable units. In addition, the ARC still provides strategic depth and surge capacity. We must ensure this development is accounted for in our doctrine. Additionally, we must record this change for critical analysis by future thinkers. Leaders armed with the doctrinal concepts, critical histories, and experiences stand the greatest chance of conceiving how to wield the Total Force effectively. 

. We will identify the full mission requirement for operational utilization of the ARC. We will synchronize the planning, programming, and budgeting of all required military personnel (MILPERS) and operation and maintenance (O&M) resources to ensure our plan for ARC operational utilization is executable.  


Air Force Culture 
Diverse backgrounds, experiences, and competencies will drive the innovative perspectives that give us agility. Therefore, diversity must become a core component of how we succeed as a Service.  
. Diversity alone will not ensure success. An environment of inclusiveness serves as a necessary catalyst to translate diversity effectively into strategic agility. An inclusive environment allows everyone to engage to their full capability without limits imposed by artificial barriers. Without inclusiveness, diverse viewpoints and creative solutions are stifled and agility is diminished. We will continue to enforce a zero-tolerance policy against discrimination, sexual assault, and abuse of power. We will move beyond ad-hoc or reactive measures as we work to address the underlying causes. In addition to credible and effective response measures, we will seek to proactively support a broad range of programs and communication activities to demonstrate Service-wide commitment to Air Force Core Values and promote an Air Force culture of professionalism. We must strengthen a character-based, respectful, and inclusive culture in the Air Force—underscored by our shared Core Values—that facilitates a blend of varied perspectives, cognitive approaches, and critical thought in planning, and unity of action in execution. 


To increase our diversity, the Air Force must generate it from external sources and cultivate it from within.  
. Externally, when set against the backdrop of generational, cultural, and demographic change and the strong competition for talent, our current recruiting efforts will need to modernize to meet both the future talent pool and the ever-changing requirements of tomorrow’s force.  We will capture new demographics in recruiting efforts, focused not merely on race or gender, but also talent, background, and experience. We will aim to build relationships with students and potential Airmen long before graduation. Beyond specific recruiting efforts, we will demonstrate the Air Force purpose and culture to a broader U.S. audience. Flight, innovation and the spirit of adventure and discovery have always captured the public’s imagination. We are an aerospace-minded nation. We need to capitalize on opportunities to reclaim public excitement and interest 


by leading or partnering in high-profile, competitive endeavors.5 We need to improve how we leverage popular entertainment to gain public exposure. We will strengthen our partnerships with the entertainment industry to increase public exposure to Airmen and Air Force capabilities. Highlighting our heritage, culture, and mission in popular media and events will increase public awareness of the Air Force and inspire a new generation of Americans to join us in service. 

. Internally, we must ensure all Airmen understand the value of diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives, as well as diverse teams. We will identify institutional barriers to creating and retaining a diverse team, and then assemble a cadre of credible leaders from a cross-section of functions to eliminate these barriers. We will hold leaders accountable for advancing diversity and inclusiveness. At the individual level, the Air Force needs to create broadening experiences for Airmen to gain exposure to different functional areas and diverse teams of contributors. We must reorient the force to the idea that the ability to cultivate and leverage diverse options is as much a critical capability as our expertise to conduct cyberspace, ISR, or mobility operations, and integrate it into all aspects of how we do business.  


5 Recent examples include, but are not limited to, Rutan Voyager, SpaceShipOne, and the Red Bull Stratos. 
Partnerships 
An ability to adapt and generate new ideas springs from sharing knowledge, attitudes, and approaches across a wide spectrum of partners. To tap into the expanse of available knowledge, we must cultivate more connections outside of the Air Force and develop our community of supporters. Likewise, we can offer our unique perspective and expertise to other sectors. We must actively invest in genuine, mutually beneficial relationships with Congress, think tanks and academia, industry, the joint and interagency team, alliances, and international partnerships to create a sustainable source of external inputs and expand our influence. The aims of these efforts are to create new learning opportunities, gain exposure to different ideas, and earn the trust of partners. 
. Congress. We will strengthen our relationship with Congress by increasing engagements based around continuity, trust, transparency, and an affinity for the Air Force: all building on existing links between Congress and various elements of the Total Force. To build continuity and trust, the Air Force will improve feedback channels and develop staffing plans that bring select officers through legislative liaison positions at multiple points over the span of their careers to ensure a continuity of personal relationships. To promote transparency, the Air Force will clearly explain the logic behind key strategic decisions, grant greater access to our processes, increase dialogue and proactive assistance. To generate affinity, the Air Force will develop a coherent and consistent narrative that communicates our Service’s position as a critical national security requirement in the eyes of legislators. Improving our relationship with Congress will help us ensure our policies, rules, and laws will enhance strategic agility. 

. Think Tanks and Academia. A broader relationship between the Air Force and experts in these communities will spur innovation and generate tangible solutions to emergent challenges. We will open more conduits between senior Air Force leaders and think tanks to stimulate accurate 


decision making and assist with effective messaging in a complex world. We will create a broader network of informed professionals who can publish and advocate the virtues of a robust Air Force. We will leverage relationships with different institutions to raise awareness of issues for further, directed study and research and capitalize on the studies of students in educational programs to document solutions. The Air Force must also incentivize and expand broadening experiences and non-traditional assignments with these institutions for our Airmen. 

. Industry. Industry is our key partner in developing technology and delivering and sustaining systems and platforms for the warfighter. The Air Force will engage in frank and open discussions with industry leaders and promising new providers to build a more responsive, adaptable, and iterative approach to capabilities development. This initiative will include restructuring requirements and acquisitions processes, as well as broadening the industrial base to include a wider array of providers. We must engage industry partners to help develop a business model that works for them and meets our needs to facilitate a healthy and competitive industrial base. We are responsible for thoughtfully shaping the industrial base through our requirements development decisions to create capability, competition, and choice resulting in agile and affordable systems and services for the warfighter. We intend to help each other eliminate or change processes, rule sets, and laws that may unintentionally inhibit creative solutions. We will improve our industry partners’ understanding of requirements and educate them on the Air Force’s shift to a systems integrator role. We will stimulate innovation in the private sector and promote cutting-edge technological development in line with the Air Force’s vision for the future by sponsoring or partnering in innovation contests. Additionally, we will regularly network with industry labs to offer insight into the operational utility of their research that could potentially open new markets for them and provide new capabilities for us. Concurrently, we will actively search for small businesses that are developing prospective disruptive technologies to provide small investments and perspective for possible game-changing innovations. 

. The Joint and Interagency Team. The Air Force provides critical capabilities across the spectrum of conflict. We are at our best when we work with our joint and interagency partners to leverage and synchronize our collective strengths. A generation of joint warriors will preserve the bonds we have built across the Services and provide multi-domain solutions to difficult problems. We will also deepen our relationship with the intelligence community, diplomatic institutions, and developmental agencies through sustained dialogue, increased training and exchange, and the rejection of parochialism. We must enhance our joint and interagency partners’ understanding of Air Force capabilities and how these capabilities complement their efforts. These measures will produce agile, comprehensive approaches to complex challenges. 

. Alliances and International Partnerships. America’s allies and coalition partners will remain vital to our success in addressing strategic challenges that increasingly span sovereign borders and strain the international system. While the Air Force can deliver unmatched capabilities, our strengths can be amplified exponentially when complemented by our global partners. Increasing partner capacity can also mitigate risks due to gaps in our own capabilities, increase access, shorten our response time, and affect the strategic calculus of potential adversaries. We will lead efforts to codify and integrate shared doctrine, tactics, and capabilities to shape and assess strategic conditions effectively, posture appropriately, and, when necessary, fight seamlessly. We must increase training and exercise opportunities to enhance trust and familiarity with allies and partners. This requires capabilities, resources, and the means for technical collaborations and 


transparent sharing wherever appropriate for mutual benefit. We will also gain insights into the abilities and willingness of allies and partners to engage in global operations and increase appreciation of the capabilities, capacities, and technologies they bring to bear. Simultaneously, we will train our Airmen to be cross-culturally competent, enabling them to be more effective in operations with allies and in global environments.

Strategic Vectors 
The five strategic vectors identified in the Air Force Strategy identify focus areas for investment, institutional change, and future operational concepts. While not exclusive, they do establish priority areas of interest. By implication, risk may be taken in other areas; however, the absence of discussion of a mission area or capability is not, in itself, intended to convey a preference for divestment or reduction.  
The strategic vectors are to: 
. Provide effective 21st-century deterrence (DTR) 

. Maintain a robust and flexible global integrated ISR capability (ISR) 

. Ensure a full-spectrum-capable, high-end-focused force (FH) 

. Pursue a multi-domain approach to our five core missions (MDA) 

. Continue the pursuit of game-changing technologies (GCT)  


VECTOR: PROVIDE EFFECTIVE 21ST-CENTURY DETERRENCE 
Section Overview.  
The Air Force must continue to contribute to strategic nuclear deterrence by strengthening and steadfastly performing the nuclear mission.  
However, we must also be prepared to confront new types of strategic threats and actors that may not be deterred by nuclear means. We need to develop new capabilities to deal with these threats and actors so we can attribute such attacks and have a range of options to respond appropriately. The Air Force’s capacities in ISR, global responsiveness, and variable effects (both lethal and non-lethal) make us uniquely suited to underwrite American deterrence in the 21st Century. We will improve these strengths through focused investments, partnerships, and education. 
Strategic Nuclear Deterrence 
The nuclear mission remains the clear priority of Air Force leaders at all levels. We will continue to place significant emphasis on the effectiveness and credibility of the nuclear enterprise. The United States will maintain a nuclear capability sufficient to inflict unacceptable costs on any state actor. Specifically, we will: 
. Ensure the effectiveness and credibility of the nuclear force. Protect investments in the sustainment of: weapons systems; nuclear command, control and communications systems; and infrastructure. This includes life extension programs to ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear force. 

. Improve weapons systems and the effectiveness of delivery systems. Reduce overall cost and complexity while maintaining a fully credible deterrent.  

. Demonstrate that we value the Airmen responsible for delivering the nuclear mission. Provide incentives and flexibility, including increased visibility, pathways for advancement, and opportunities to transition between career tracks both within and outside the nuclear enterprise. 


Deterring Other Strategic Attacks 
More actors today have access to technologies with catastrophic effects. These include radiological, chemical and biological weapons, and the means to conduct attacks in space and cyberspace. All of these could have a strategic impact on the United States or its vital interests. Deterring states and non-state actors whose interests, structures, value systems, and objectives mean that they may not respond to nuclear deterrence will require additional capabilities to detect, monitor, attribute, and respond accordingly to undesired behavior while minimizing the risk of escalation or wider conflict.  
The core concepts of deterrence do not change. We must identify our intended audience(s), present a credible threat capable of inflicting certain and unacceptable costs on their interests, effectively communicate this message, and demonstrate the will to act. To deter opponents successfully, we must understand what they want to achieve and what they are not willing to sacrifice. The latter may include aspects like state (or transnational) support and funding or encompass less tangible factors like public support, ideology, perceived legitimacy, or personal reputation. Certain actors may not view deterrence in 
the classic sense—in these cases our efforts will focus on depriving them of the initiative and neutralizing their ability to threaten our interests.  
Deterrence and cost-imposing strategies. A cost-imposing strategy induces an opponent to respond in a manner that produces greater hardship for the adversary than the friendly side. Deterrence represents a competitive arena to implement such an approach. Our aim is to offset the threat by maximizing the potential of our constrained defense resources in innovative ways that elicit responses that are cost-prohibitive to the adversary. Concurrently, we will confound adversary attempts to impose excessive costs on the United States by finding affordable asymmetric approaches that undermine opposing capabilities, postures, and operating concepts. We will engage in the greater U.S. grand strategy conversation to ensure our efforts will not create undesired second- and third-order effects. A perceived threat to a competitor could provoke undesirable counter responses; including a decision to strike first as a form of asymmetric capability. Introducing new capabilities, changing force postures, or revising operating concepts may strengthen our deterrence in the near-term while paving the road to escalation and conflict in the far term. We will weigh each of these opportunities based on the degree to which they enhance or diminish our strategic agility and response options. 
The Air Force offers unique capabilities to deter a wide range of actors across the spectrum of conflict using both lethal and non-lethal means. We can enhance these capabilities by the continuing development of multi-domain ISR with products and services that can be widely disseminated to allies and the public. Many actors are emboldened by the perception of anonymity, particularly in the cyberspace domain or when using other asymmetric means. To counter these threats, we will: 
. Enhance integrated, multi-domain ISR to detect, monitor, and attribute threats. These initiatives should focus not just on the signatures of weapon systems and their production, but also identify individuals, groups, and supporting networks. Advancing capabilities within the information environment, particularly the cyberspace domain, will be a priority.  

. Increase the ability to share and release integrated, multi-domain ISR intelligence and knowledge. This will greatly help whole-of-government and international efforts and bolster international law and norms. An improved ability to share intelligence and knowledge with international partners will help build coalitions against all types of adversaries. Furthermore, the demonstrated ability to accurately detect, analyze, track, share timely intelligence and assess actions taken can significantly enhance deterrence operations. An adversary who cannot achieve surprise through an act of violence has lost one of his most potent instruments: shock value. 

. Develop new response options ranging across domains. These options include non-kinetic, reversible actions at global ranges to increase our ability to deter a wider range of actors and address unpredicted operational challenges. This may require judicious demonstrations of capabilities hitherto held at high security levels. 

. Improve our ability to apply levels of deterrence and coercion. Key to this will be education and development of senior leaders, as well as improving our understanding of potential adversary mindsets, strategic calculus, and decision-making processes to apply tailored coercive and deterrent capabilities at the right time and place and control escalation and de-escalation, especially in crisis.

VECTOR: MAINTAIN A ROBUST AND FLEXIBLE GLOBAL INTEGRATED INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE AND RECONNAISSANCE CAPABILITY 
Section Overview. From advanced urban environments to austere corners of the planet, the availability of technology and global interconnectivity is making the collection, analysis, and use of information and knowledge increasingly decisive across the spectrum of conflict. At the same time, the core motivations that drive human conflict have not changed. As a Service, we must be willing to acknowledge that no degree of technological proficiency can guarantee total situational awareness nor predict every crisis. Fortunately, options exist to ensure we maintain an enduring advantage over less-nimble adversaries. The Air Force will conduct agile ISR by: 
     .    Deepening our understanding and assessment of potential adversary capabilities and intentions. 
     .    Ensuring elasticity and fusion in systems and organizations. 
     .    Focusing air, space, and cyberspace collection, exploitation, and analysis to inform and support commanders’ decisions. 
ISR can affect the behavior of adversaries who believe or know they are being watched. Deterrence is effective only when the adversary is aware of a threat and believes it to be prohibitive and credible. Effective ISR acts as a critical enabler of deterrence and helps friendly forces seize the initiative from adversaries who realize their activities can be or have been detected and thwarted. In addition, it can be used to disarm those who manipulate information to distract, delay, or derail our efforts. Despite our best efforts, resolute adversaries will constantly modify strategies and tactics to seek surprise, freedom of maneuver, and asymmetric advantages. The Air Force will never assume an ISR approach or capability that is effective today will be effective tomorrow, and our Airmen will employ agile cross-domain solutions to detect, characterize, deter and, when necessary, defeat adversaries across all operating environments. Anticipation of adversary adaptations and innovations will allow for rapid responses in capability development and our ISR collection, exploitation, and analytic techniques. This will require developing our Total Force to think and act cross-culturally. 
ISR must be dynamic and elastic. The Air Force must enhance its capability to transition rapidly from global surveillance operations to tasks in support of specific warfighter needs. Near-peer state adversaries, transnational non-state threats, and localized contingencies all demand different approaches to - and combinations of - ISR. We must endeavor to discern these insights before and while we direct our advanced assets, adapting as circumstances evolve. We must train and equip Airmen to conduct effective multi-domain ISR anywhere in the world in all domains and operating environments, even if we lack full knowledge of the cultural and technical specifics of every potential adversary we may face. This acceptance of uncertainty, coupled with limitations in resources and operational reach, necessitates an agile, coordinated ISR approach that provides commanders with multiple options to inform prudent decisions. Air Force doctrine must evolve to be both more directive of and more responsive to ISR efforts and better able to integrate information efforts with options that include lethal and non-lethal effects. We 
will make our data and information available to all users across the joint team, as well as our international partners as appropriate. To ensure our partner nations are able to access necessary intelligence, we will work for increased integration and strive to remove unnecessary and outdated classification barriers. We will begin by ensuring that wherever possible, classified material is generated in such a way that it is releasable to our trusted allies. In turn, these partners will bolster our ISR resources and deliver critical contextual insight for improved decision advantage.  
ISR also must be technologically elastic. Technology has made information sharing easier and faster, and all data have the potential to increase the richness of our characterization and understanding of adversaries and the environment. Advanced ISR sensors remain essential, but intelligence also emerges from innovative methods of linking disparate data streams from open sources or international partners. Skilled intelligence professionals are the key to employing technological capabilities to produce accurate, actionable intelligence. However, in a dynamic environment, there may not always be time for every point of collected data to be translated into intelligence or reviewed by an analyst. In certain critical situations, collected data may need to flow directly to a cockpit or senior leader, regardless of collection method. The same data can simultaneously flow to an intelligence analyst to be analyzed for deeper context. To keep pace with technology, we will ensure that analysis training and education implements the principles of critical thinking across the ISR enterprise. We will also develop and deploy analysis architecture and tools to better automate, visualize, collaborate, and integrate analysis and exploitation. Prudent human-machine teaming will enhance our agility. Proper integration of automated systems within a common network will empower skilled intelligence personnel to convert mass data into actionable intelligence and knowledge and then rapidly convey it to the appropriate recipients, from national authorities to tactical warfighters.

VECTOR: ENSURE A FULL-SPECTRUM-CAPABLE, HIGH-END-FOCUSED FORCE 
Section Overview. While the Air Force has conducted nonstop combat operations for more than two decades, multiple adversaries have observed our strengths and developed advanced methods and technologies to counter our dominance in the air, space, and cyberspace domains. These threats will shape the future of warfare, and we cannot afford the risk of stagnation in high-end operations. We must refocus our capabilities to ensure we can operate against demanding adversaries who will certainly challenge our freedom of operation in multiple domains. Our priorities will include: 
      .     Developing capabilities that ensure freedom of action for the joint force. 
      .      Leveraging and integrating new approaches, technologies and capabilities. 
      .      Delivering more effects at range. 
      .      Increasing our resiliency when presence within the battlespace is required. 
      .      Retaining the ability to operate across the full spectrum of operations. 
Posture to set conditions for Joint Force success in the most demanding scenarios. The Air Force must be able to deliver effects against challenging threats and in challenging operating environments. In recent operations, airpower has provided asymmetric advantages in largely permissive environments. Analysis of the future strategic environment (see AFSEA) indicates that we are increasingly likely to face sophisticated enemies with advanced capabilities. As the other Services build more capacity to operate in hostile environments, the Air Force must focus clearly on the capabilities that will allow freedom of maneuver and decisive action in highly contested spaces and extreme and/or contaminated environments. Without high-end air, space, and cyberspace capabilities, these denied regions will pose significant, if not insurmountable, obstacles to friendly forces. Our greatest value to the joint force is dealing with these advanced threats, including:  
. Advanced Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS) with both surface-to-air and air-to-air capabilities that will challenge our technological edge 

. Denied or contested electromagnetic environment 

. Physical threat to forward operating locations, particularly the growing threat from adversary ballistic and cruise missiles 

. Cyber threat to all operations (home and overseas) 

. Threats to space-based capabilities 


Gain freedom of action for the joint force. In a high-end conflict, this is our highest priority and is needed to prevent effective enemy interference with friendly operations. Our respective aims across the air, space, and cyberspace domains are: 
. Air: Achieving the required degree of control of the air, protection of the joint force, and freedom of action for a given period and in the required area. 


. Space: Maintaining freedom of action in, from, and to space to provide mission assurance for joint operations (Joint Publication 3-14, Annex 3-14) and to meet the needs of the national security space enterprise. 

. Cyberspace: Freedom of action in cyberspace and the ability to deny the same to our adversaries (Joint Publication 3-12, Annex 3-12). 


Navigation, communications, and targeting capabilities are critical to high-end operations. As our adversaries challenge our ability to employ these capabilities, we will increase resiliency and continuously improve the doctrine and TTPs necessary to fight through adversary threats. While we continue to design, procure, and operate systems that are capable of withstanding attack or maneuvering through the threat, we will also develop alternative methods to provide these capabilities, to include non-space-based options.  
We must strengthen our analysis and targeting processes while complicating those of the enemy. This requires us to gain situational awareness and knowledge while degrading or denying the enemy’s. We must expect our current technological advantages to wane, requiring us to invest in new capabilities. However, we must be mindful that few “silver bullets” exist and no technological edge goes unchallenged. Our capabilities development must be informed by an enhanced focus on adversarial innovations and technologies that could hinder our operations or otherwise provide an operational edge to our adversaries. Seeking single-point solutions may appear cost-effective, but carry high risk. We must continue to investigate multiple technologies and concepts, building off-ramps as well as on-ramps to maintain relative advantage as technologies emerge and fade. We must also regain and enhance our proficiency in operational security and information operations, to include military deception. 
Integrate air, space, and cyberspace effects delivered by any Service in support of the campaign. Air, space, and cyberspace activities and targeting will be integrated for joint battlespace effects throughout the planning, targeting, execution, and assessment cycle. We will focus on developing common architecture to enable integration and command and control of a diverse set of multi-domain platforms, sensors, communications architectures, and weapons. 
Deliver more effects at range. We will deliver effects at range wherever possible to mitigate the increasing area-denial threat to forward bases and to employ a smaller force more efficiently. This will combine: 
. Investment in long-range, stand-off capabilities. In the far-term, we will invest in longer-range, high-speed platforms, sensors, and weapons as well as multi-domain capabilities that can create effects globally from home base such as cyberspace attack, space-delivered effects, and remotely operated or autonomous platforms. This will permit alternative weapons effects including temporary and reversible impacts. This will decrease the size of the necessary expeditionary force and thus redefine readiness requirements and force presentation models. In human terms, this will allow much greater flexibility in employment models, with the possibility of a more diverse workforce using different work patterns. 

. Fewer long-term deployed forces. Delivery of timely, assured effects using global resources will allow Combatant Commands to reduce their requirements for assigned, organic forces based in their geographic area. In the near- to mid-term, this can be accomplished by employing Combat Mission Ready forces combining agile basing with rotational deployments, forward presence, and long-range assets. To conserve our resources and facilitate our operations, we will 


adapt our basing to optimally leverage the environmental infrastructure in the locations where we operate.  

. Increase C2 agility to permit distribution of control and execution. To support a more flexible force with the ability to deliver effects globally, we will need to revisit our C2 paradigms to permit rapid and appropriate adaptation between centralized and decentralized models. Some capabilities may need to be directed at a national level whereas other situations demand an ability to push authority to lower levels than current models allow. 

. Improve speed of execution. While enabled by improvements in weapons and platforms, true advances will come with rapid, accurate, shared situational awareness. We will develop human-machine teaming including automated processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED) and new C2 practices. By automating suitable data processing tasks, we will be able to employ a smaller number of analysts to perform more skilled interpretation tasks that require human analysis. 


Improve resiliency of forward-deployed and stateside forces. Where we must retain a forward presence or need to project power, we will minimize vulnerability. We will reduce the human and physical footprint of forward-stationed forces to the minimum required for sustained operations and develop agile employment and basing concepts. Energy (in its many forms) is the backbone of nearly every element of Air Force operations in air, space, and cyberspace. We will also improve resiliency by reducing our dependence on vulnerable single-point energy sources and utility grids. We can realize significant gains by leveraging advances in manufacturing, energy efficiency, and renewable resources. We will leverage the combat support capabilities of partner nations on lower-risk tasks to reduce U.S. costs further. Bases within likely threat envelopes will need to employ enhanced active and passive protective measures such as protection against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and increasingly accurate and lethal conventional ballistic and cruise missiles. Where we need to have the ability to “stand in” rapidly, we will employ light, agile, high-readiness forces with a small but resilient footprint that can deploy to the widest possible variety of austere locations.  
Improve mission assurance of our space capabilities and be prepared to deny the same to potential adversaries. Air Force space-based capabilities and effects are more than enablers for other domains; they are vital to U.S. national security. Today, these capabilities face advanced, demonstrated, and evolving threats. At the same time, potential adversaries are fielding their own space-based capabilities and becoming increasingly reliant upon space for their military operations, which may be conducted against the United States or our interests. To succeed in the future, we must be able to shape the strategic environment, contribute to crisis stability, and ensure the United States possesses the space capabilities needed to achieve success in any conflict. To do this, the Air Force will assure space capabilities against aggressive and comprehensive counter-space programs through resilient capabilities, agile defense, reconstitution, and robust C2 and communications. The Air Force must also possess the ability, when necessary, to deny space capabilities to potential adversaries who leverage space in their own military operations. 
Retain full-spectrum capabilities. The demand for Air Force capabilities is not likely to diminish simply because resources are constrained. Accordingly, we must continue to devise innovative ways to accomplish missions across the spectrum of conflict, to include employing high-end assets in other than extreme cases. While the significant increases in the organic firepower and ISR capabilities of the other Services should allow the Air Force to reduce emphasis on tactical tasks in a permissive environment, we 
must not permit our focus on high-end conflict to cause the skills we have gained in low-intensity conflict to atrophy. We will retain many of these skills among experienced personnel with the ability to regenerate capabilities rapidly across the wider force. We will also consider investments in limited numbers of platforms, munitions, and off-the-shelf solutions optimized for lower-intensity situations when it is cost effective to do so. However, we will not posture for extended stabilization operations, nor will low-intensity operations be the primary focus of our capability development.

VECTOR: PURSUE A MULTI-DOMAIN APPROACH TO OUR FIVE CORE MISSIONS 
Section Overview. Airpower, cyberspace functions, and space-based capabilities have become indispensable components of modern military operations. In order to achieve the most effective solutions across the spectrum of military operations, the Air Force will increasingly rely on operations executed in or through the cyberspace and space domains in addition to air activities, and Air Force operations in these three domains must be coordinated or integrated with effects generated in the land and maritime domains. 
We must focus on ensuring freedom of action within temporal and spatial bounds in all five of the domains, enabled by multi-domain, synergistic mission execution. The most critical component of this approach will be the development of a multi-domain mindset among Airmen throughout the Service. The Air Force must ensure that its systems and processes support this mindset to ensure mission accomplishment in a complex environment. 
In order to foster a multi-domain approach, the Air Force will: 
. Holistically develop best practices to integrate capabilities and operations in all domains. This will benefit employment in the near term and force planning in the long term. If our ability to act in one domain is limited, we will flex to operations in other domains to achieve the required effect.  

. For any given task, integrate planning to use capabilities in all domains to achieve desired effects and outcomes. Reliance on conventional air platforms can be reduced where assured capability can be provided through cyberspace or space-based capabilities; conversely, kinetic operations may more often be directed at achieving cyberspace effects or affecting space control rather than attacking conventional targets. We will also develop novel ways of delivering effects into and through cyberspace and space from air platforms. Our aim will be to generate an overmatch by integrating effects across all domains, including effects generated by our joint and combined partners in surface and maritime domains. 

. Adapt our thinking and culture. This will ensure that when presented with a problem, we are able to consider a range of lawful options and possible effects using multiple domains. A side effect of our unmatched success in producing highly proficient tactical operators is the evolution of processes, structures, and mindsets which are not optimized for multi-domain approaches. This mindset shift may be our greatest challenge as an Air Force. It will require a reappraisal of current classifications and compartmentalization to ensure planners and targeteers appreciate the full range of capability available to commanders and understand the likely effects in terms of precision, persistence, collateral damage, reversibility, assurance, and lethality.  

. Institutionalize multi-domain approaches into the education, training, and employment of Airmen from the operator to the component commander. This will require us to conduct experimentation to develop, explore, and assess new concepts of operations, training programs, simulations, war games, and exercises that reflect and account for these new integrated operations. Our human capital development should seek ways to widen operator perspectives without sacrificing their tactical expertise. Training is central to both of these aims, and we must 


develop suitable systems and ranges across the live, virtual, and constructive spectrum to facilitate these efforts. 

. Review our force employment models. New capabilities best controlled centrally or at a national level may permit a reduction in the conventional forces allocated to Combatant Commanders, provided theater air staffs are able to access the required effects with a suitable degree of assurance. 


Air and Space Superiority. The Air Force has dominated the air domain for a generation, enabling joint domination of the land and maritime domains. However, the technological and training advantages we have enjoyed since the Cold War are being increasingly contested by adversaries. While other actors have adapted, advanced their capabilities, invested heavily in realistic training, and developed and fielded ballistic and cruise missiles and unmanned air systems to augment traditional air capabilities, we have not kept pace. Further, concepts of ‘dominance’ are probably inappropriate in the space and cyber domains. While the space domain used to be considered the unassailable “high ground,” our space assets today are endangered by a variety of kinetic and non-kinetic threats. The lower cost of entry to operations in and through the cyberspace domain, together with the difficulty in attribution, means that a wide range of adversaries will more readily challenge us in and through this domain. We must be ready to defend against these challenges. Accordingly, the Air Force will: 
. Take advantage of cyberspace- and space-based capabilities to constrain adversaries’ actions and increase our situational understanding both in the physical domains and within cyberspace so to maintain freedom to maneuver and focus the combat power we have appropriately. 

. Integrate all appropriate air and space platforms with cyberspace capabilities to maximize integrated lethal and non-lethal effects. Integration of capabilities in all domains will enable freedom of action for the joint force. This requires a common C2 and communications architecture to create a combat network in which capabilities on any platform can be exploited in a way that is transparent to the operators at either end of the effects chain.  


Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance. As we rebalance to the higher end of the spectrum of conflict, we will rely less on ISR data collected from airborne or space-borne capabilities that cannot operate in a contested environment. We will address the challenges of operating in contested environments in a variety of ways: 
. Enhance stand-off capabilities and invest in multi-domain, penetrating ISR capabilities. We need to combine the ability to achieve the necessary access with the required persistence. We will invest in air, space, and cyberspace platform and sensor capabilities enabling access to targets anywhere around the world. Some of these capabilities will enhance our existing long-range collection assets that operate from the continental United States (CONUS). Others will increase our persistence from space and our ability to rapidly deploy gap-filling capabilities. Other enhancements will include the ability to work in and through cyberspace to help characterize specific target sets and understand adversaries. In all cases, we will use a multi-domain, all-source mindset to focus the ISR enterprise on providing the right analysis and delivery of key intelligence in order to offer commanders well-informed options.  

. Integrate sensors on all platforms. Wherever possible, we will integrate joint, interagency, and coalition information sources to create a fused understanding of the adversary and the environment. We will exploit automation for appropriate on-platform processing, improved 


combat identification, and targeting. By integrating data from as many sources as possible, we will increase the resilience of our ISR network so if one domain capability is denied (for example, due to adversary space-control activity), our understanding of the battlespace is not catastrophically disrupted.  

. Ensure rapid and wide dissemination of processed ISR data. Once collected, data must be fused and analyzed and the resulting intelligence disseminated to all customers and decision-makers at the right time. This will require layered, mutually supportive analytic capabilities; improved intelligence generation and dissemination methods that span joint, interagency, and international constructs; and collaboration at multiple clearance levels while maintaining appropriate security controls. 

. Prioritize and pursue attribution capabilities. We will improve our abilities to attribute action in space and cyberspace to specific actors, both state and non-state. 


Rapid Global Mobility. The Air Force plays a critical role in expeditionary and deployed operations globally. We will aim to improve our effectiveness by pursuing multi-domain solutions to mobility challenges such as: 
. Smart and adaptive global distribution networks (including autonomous systems and cyberspace capabilities) both across and within theaters to ensure the most efficient movement and positioning of supplies. This will require a more agile posture and will take us beyond the conventional ‘hub-and-spoke’ approach to one that optimizes those networks through a DOD-wide approach. 

. Reduce the logistic tail and enhance sustainability. Highly efficient airframe and engine designs will provide significant energy savings and enhanced range capabilities. Advanced manufacturing techniques, such as 3-D printing, could overcome the need to deploy a range of spare components that may not all be needed. 


Global Strike. The Air Force will continue to be the Nation’s pre-eminent means of projecting force rapidly at global ranges. We will expand our precision strike capability to maximize cross-domain integration, including a range of alternative weapons effects including some that may be temporary or reversible. 
. Operate globally while minimizing vulnerable forward deployments. Develop capabilities to enable full-spectrum effects in and through cyberspace, from space, or using air platforms and sensors with global range. 

. Provide rapid or immediate effects and assessment of our actions, using all sources of information including multi-domain and open-source data. 


Command and Control. Our C2 model will need to be agile enough to integrate air, space, and cyberspace effects delivered directly and remotely and by different Services or agencies. We need to develop a networked, agile, and self-organizing system to achieve measured effects at the right place and time. We must: 
. Fully integrate effects achieved through the space and cyberspace domains into planning and targeting at all levels, and be prepared to integrate effects achieved through land and maritime domains as a Joint Task Force.  


. Increase flexibility of C2. As well as multi-domain integration within traditional theater air operations centers (AOCs), we must be able both to permit more widely distributed control and execution, and also to inform and direct efforts centrally at the theater and national levels. 

. Ensure resiliency of our networks by exploiting developments in self-healing and adaptive systems and proactive defense against attack from all domains, especially cyberspace. 

. Develop the ability to integrate air, space, and cyberspace effects delivered by any Service in support of the theater campaign. This will require more agile approaches to C2 in environments where freedom of maneuver and communications are contested or denied. This includes not only technological achievement, but also more flexible thought for operational and tactical-level execution. 

. Develop new and innovative methods to overcome the increasing adversary challenges to our command and control networks.

VECTOR: CONTINUE THE PURSUIT OF GAME-CHANGING TECHNOLOGIES 
Section Overview. The purpose of this strategic vector is not to identify specific technologies that may become game-changers, but instead outline a strategic approach and the supporting elements necessary to bring forth the next generation of game-changing capabilities. Game-changers do not result solely from technology, but rather from the specific ways in which a technology is applied in an operational capability—and how such capabilities are employed. Key elements necessary to cultivate game-changing capabilities include innovative people, ideas and concepts, experimentation, and an active, engaged leadership: 
     .     Innovative people are essential for an innovative organization, and these individuals should be discovered and developed to serve on experimentation teams. 
     .     Ideas and concepts come from casting a wide net to catch as many good ideas from as many sources as possible and then making many small investments to yield research concepts and prototypes to experiment with in small venues like wargames or exercises to develop operational applications. 
     .     Experimentation, through a “campaign of experiments,” allows teams to explore new ideas and capability concepts through an iterative process and develop the insights that produce innovative solutions to a problem. 
     .     Active, engaged leadership must be willing to take risk in exploring and championing new ideas and allow ourselves to fail cheaply and adapt early. 
Many of these elements exist in the Air Force today. However, we must build upon them to improve our ability to remain at the forefront of harnessing breakthroughs that shape our future. 
Fostering Game-Changing Approaches and Technologies. The technological advantage the Air Force has maintained since its inception was not predestined. It was the result of a strategic choice to explore and mature new technologies balanced with an understanding that military problems will never have final or universal solutions. Only through a constant pursuit of science and a rapid adoption of innovation can the security of the Nation be maintained. The story of our Air Force is a prime example of the innovative application of game-changing approaches and technologies. Our history testifies to our ongoing quest to exploit new advances from the jet engine to nuclear weapons, space, stealth, cyberspace operations and remotely-piloted systems in new approaches. We must continue to pursue radical improvements in technology in order to maintain the asymmetric advantage over adversaries. Game-changing capabilities typically result from a technological approach applied to a military problem that radically alters the balance of power between potential adversaries. As mentioned in the Air Force Strategy, hypersonics, nanotechnology, directed energy, unmanned systems, and autonomous systems each offer promising possibilities. However, in the future we will generate new combinations of technologies and domains we cannot yet describe, or even imagine, that will shape the way our Service provides airpower. We will 
forge ahead on a path of innovation to achieve strategic agility – breaking paradigms and leveraging technology. The pace of change drives the imperative for agility, which implies anticipation over reaction and shaping over responding.  
People. Innovation is the result of insightful, collaborative interactions that occur when exceptional people are brought together in creative environments. We must develop innovation catalysts that leverage creative people throughout the entire Air Force who are passionate about innovation in specific fields and capitalize on their natural interests and talents. Few people are naturally innovative, and the ones who are may be overlooked for opportunities to contribute effectively because they often see things differently than the rest of their organization. This can place them at odds with the organization and stifle their voice. True innovators can be recognized as people who work best in environments where risk, openness, and idea-sharing are the norm; where ideas outrank seniority; where being wrong is not a failure; where learning is recognized as a continual process; and who have a sense of urgency, energy, and optimism. They challenge their own ideas as much as those of others and continually push new ideas and approaches for doing things. A process for discovering and cultivating such people is essential for an innovative organization, and these individuals should be candidates to serve on experimentation teams.  
Ideas and Concepts. Innovative organizations actively seek ideas from the broadest possible base. New ideas must be sought out and given an audience, regardless of the originator’s position in the organization. We must cast a wide net to catch as many good ideas from as many possible sources while being fully aware that innovation often comes from outside traditional DoD sources. This requires actively seeking ideas from the private sector, including from non-DoD affiliated firms, small businesses, academia, and international communities. Few ideas will represent viable innovations on their own in the form in which they are proposed. However, they may contain a key concept or insight that, when combined with other ideas, can lead to a clearer understanding of what might be possible or provide an entirely new approach to solving a problem. They may even lead to the solution of a completely different problem. Innovations usually do not directly result from the original ideas themselves. Instead, they are the product of putting ideas into an experimentation environment where creative teams of technologists and operators can combine, explore, and develop them to discover any hidden insights. As a result, innovative ideas and concepts should not be constrained by current doctrines or requirements of current solution approaches. Nor should they be assessed by their performance in relation to measures established for completely different solution approaches. Most new ideas will perform worse than accepted solution paths being explored from the current status quo. An innovation becomes the preferred solution approach only when it is understood in terms of the new CONOPS in which it will operate and in the context of new measures appropriate for that CONOPS.  
We will mature promising technologies by making many small investments. Through our people and their connections, we will gain access to paradigm-changing capabilities while they are still nascent. This presents an opportunity to either adapt emerging ideas to our purpose or provide a requirement to innovators based on operational needs. This interaction will yield research concepts and prototypes with which we can experiment in small venues like wargames or exercises to develop operational applications. By injecting S&T opportunities into experimentation campaigns and development planning efforts, we will increase the speed of development and assess the utility of new concepts earlier in the process. Although the Air Force will make small investments in many promising technologies, only a small fraction may pay off. This operating methodology is prevalent, proven, and successful in the private sector, and works on the same principle as classic venture capital endeavors. For instance, investors in 
Silicon Valley expect in advance that only 10 of 100 startup investments might turn a future profit or return on investment. Of those 10 profitable ventures, one might succeed in a spectacular way in which the investment pays off 10,000 to 1. By exploring innovative concepts and technologies to deepen our knowledge and understanding of their potential, we can make these investments more intelligently.  
Experimentation. A “campaign of experiments” is the process by which experimentation teams explore new ideas and capability concepts for the interplay between technologies and CONOPS, develop the insights that produce a deep understanding of potential future environments, and discover combinations that provide innovative solutions to a problem. For any given problem, the campaign is a sequence of challenge-based experiments that progresses from a typically simple initial venue to a final one in which the proposed solution can be understood in an operational context. Frequent experimentation with analysis and sharing of results are keys to achieving system-wide (or multi-system) innovations. Over the course of the campaign, the succession of experiments explores increasingly deeper aspects of the problem to develop a clearer understanding of approaches to potential solutions. This understanding will inform Air Force strategic planning and S&T investments. It will help answer key questions regarding which promising technologies we invest in, given limited resources. It will also provide a greater level of confidence that those investments will ultimately pay off and under what conditions. 
Active, Engaged Leadership and Institutional Mindset. An institutional mindset shift is required. The Air Force must be willing to take risk in exploring and championing new ideas, despite the fact that multiple failures may precede success. We must evolve culturally to value the learning outcomes and progress gained from failed attempts. We must allow ourselves to fail cheaply and early to adapt and avoid subsequent catastrophic failure. We must not permit the risks associated with change to overshadow the more detrimental risks of stagnation. The Air Force has the unique opportunity to model this approach, which offers a relatively inexpensive, low-risk way to seize opportunities and pursue game-changing technologies. Leadership should encourage and facilitate interactions among organizations, maintain the momentum of change, and resist any institutional inertia or resistance that clings to narrowly-focused, non-integrated, single-domain solutions and processes at the expense of potentially more promising AF-wide, multi-domain options.
