DOD Dictionary of 
Military and Associated Terms 


PREFACE 

1. Scope 
The DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms (DOD Dictionary) sets forth standard US military and associated terminology to encompass the joint activity of the Armed Forces of the United States.  These military and associated terms, together with their definitions, constitute approved Department of Defense (DOD) terminology for general use by all DOD components. 

2. Purpose 
This publication supplements standard English-language dictionaries and standardizes military and associated terminology to improve communication and mutual understanding within DOD with other US Government departments and agencies and among the United States and its allies. 

3. Application 
This publication applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Services, the Joint Staff, combatant commands, DOD agencies, and all other DOD components.  It is the primary terminology source when preparing correspondence, to include policy, strategy, doctrine, and planning documents.  Criteria for inclusion of terminology in the DOD Dictionary is enumerated in Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 5025.12, Standardization of Military and Associated Terminology, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 5705.01, Standardization of Military and Associated Terminology. 

4. Format 
The primary parts of the DOD Dictionary are: 
a. 
Explanatory notes. 

b. 
Terms and definitions. 

c. 
Shortened word forms (i.e., abbreviations, acronyms, and initialisms). 



5. DOD Dictionary Online Availability and Update Schedule  
The DOD Dictionary is accessible online as a searchable database and in PDF format at the following Internet address: http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary and at the following Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) address: https://jdeis.js.mil/jdeis/. The contents of the DOD Dictionary are updated on a monthly basis to include any terminology additions, modifications, or deletions made within the previous calendar month in accordance with CJCSI 5705.01.   

6. Terminology Repository for DOD (OSD/JS) Issuances 
This publication is supplemented by the Terminology Repository for DOD (OSD/JS) Issuances (Terminology Repository).  Over the last 65 years, specific and technical DOD terms and definitions established in senior policy document glossaries reside outside of the DOD Dictionary and not subject to joint doctrine terminology criteria for general and universal usage listed in CJCSI 5705.01.  The Terminology Repository provides awareness on those specific or descriptive terms in defense documents (policy, strategy, planning, doctrine, etc.) that support the foundation of the DOD Dictionary.  Its creation is the first step in deconflicting terminology nuances within organizational documents that may impact joint doctrine. 

7. DOD Term and Definition Development Approach 
After consulting DODI 5025.12 and CJCSI 5705.01 for term and definition criteria, developers will first review the DOD Dictionary and then access the Terminology Repository before defaulting to commonly used, English-language dictionaries in creating new DOD terms  and definitions. The  repository is located at http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine /dod_dictionary/index.html. 

8. Revision 
Future editions of the DOD Dictionary will be updated according to policy and posted online at: http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/index.html.

EXPLANATORY NOTES 

1. Updates 
Per guidance in CJCSI 5705.01, Standardization of Military and Associated Terminology, terminology changes to the DOD Dictionary (additions, modifications, or deletions of DOD terminology) are approved using one of the following five methods:  
a. DOD terminology proposed from JPs;  
b. 
DOD terminology directed by the Secretary of Defense, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, or CJCS via Specific Memorandum;  

c. DOD terminology proposed from DOD (OSD and CJCS) issuances; 

d. 
Terminology proposed from Allied Administrative Publication-6, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Glossary of Terms and Definitions (English and French); and/or 


e. Approved administrative changes/updates by the DOD Terminologist. 

2. Terminology Categorization (Policy and Joint Doctrine) 
a. 
Military Terminology. Standardized military and associated terminology forms the foundation of joint doctrine.  It enables the joint force to organize, plan, train, and execute operations with a common language that is clearly articulated and universally understood. Since 1948, military terms have been codified in the DOD Dictionary.  Although different in purpose, policy documents also require standardized terminology.  While some policy terms are included in the DOD Dictionary, the bulk are codified in the Terminology Repository of DOD (OSD/JS) Issuances.  Policy terms may form the basis of doctrinal terms, further describe doctrinal concepts, or temporarily fill gaps in joint doctrine until adopted as extant practice. If included in the DOD Dictionary, policy terms should conform to the CJCSI 5705.01 and standing operating procedure guidelines. 

b. 
Policy and Joint Doctrine.  Policy directs and assigns tasks, prescribes desired capabilities, and provides guidance for ensuring the Armed Forces of the United States are prepared to perform their assigned roles.  Implicitly, policy can create new roles and requirements for new capabilities.  Joint doctrine enhances the operational effectiveness of the Armed Forces by providing authoritative guidance and standardized terminology on topics relevant to the employment of military forces.  Although joint doctrine is neither policy nor strategy, it serves to make United States policy and strategy effective in the application of United States military power. Terminology developed within policy and joint doctrine serves different purposes.  The terminology required to support the employment of forces (doctrinal terms) may not be optimal for policy developers, whose purpose may be to illuminate resource or requirement documents.  Terminology developed for DOD policy is not limited by the constraints imposed on doctrine terminology.  Policy definitions may provide the basis for the doctrinal terms.  Doctrinal terms cannot be in conflict with the law, regulation, or policy. 



3. Terminology Definition Development 
The DOD Dictionary is designed to supplement common English-language dictionaries with standard terminology for military and associated use.  After reviewing policy for criteria and the DOD Dictionary for existence, developers must consult the Terminology Repository before defaulting to commonly used, English-language dictionaries as a starting point in creating new DOD Dictionary terms and definitions.  A definition should address the meaning of the term only and should not contain doctrinal or procedural information (i.e., it should focus on describing “what” a term is and not “how” or “why” it is used).  If additional text is desired to elaborate on a definition, that information should be provided in the text of the publication.  Accordingly, the following CJCSI 5705.01 and standing operating procedure criteria are used to determine the acceptability of terminology for inclusion in the DOD Dictionary: 
a. The term in a standard, commonly accepted dictionary is inadequate for DOD use. 
b. 
The term is not a standard dictionary definition with non-definitional text added. Example: capability - The ability to complete a task or execute a course of action under specified conditions and level of performance. 

c. 
The term is not self-defining.  Example: bomber aircraft – An aircraft that is capable of delivery bombs. 

d. 
The term is not a policy term that competes or overrides a doctrinal term in the DOD Dictionary. 

e. 
The proposed term follows established procedures in this issuance.  Verification must be provided that the DOD Terminologist approved; otherwise, the term will only be reflected in the Terminology Repository. 

f. Reflects extant DOD capabilities and practices. 

g. 
Of general military or associated significance.  Technical or highly specialized terms may be included if they can be defined in easily understood language and if their inclusion is of general military or associated significance. 

h. Terms for weaponry are limited to generic weapon systems. 

i. 
Are not to consist of or contain shortened word forms (e.g., abbreviations, acronyms, or initialisms). 

j. 
Must be UNCLASSIFIED (including shortened word forms) and marked as such if in controlled (e.g., FOUO) or classified documents. 

k. 
Are not prowords, code words, brevity words, or NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization]-only terms. 

l. 
Are not Service-specific or functionality-specific unless they are commonly employed in US joint force operations. 

m. An approved joint term with similar definition does not exist. 

n. 
Must be consistent with US law, treaties, international agreements, and executive orders. 

o. 
Noun terms should be in singular form. 

p. 
With few exceptions, should be general terms, not proper names. 



q. 
Cross reference entries (i.e., ‘also called’ terms) will not have a separate entry. Example: ‘Universal Time’ is also called ‘ZULU time,’ but no separate entry for ‘ZULU time’. 

r. 
Terms must appear and be used in the body of the document, not just in its glossary. 

s. 
Proposed entries should be written as a definition and not as a description. 




See CJCSI 5705.01, Standardization of Military and Associated Terminology, Enclosure C, “Definition Writing Guide,” for specific guidance that should be followed when developing terms and definitions intended for inclusion in the DOD Dictionary.   

4. Shortened Word Forms (i.e., Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Initialisms) 
The DOD Dictionary includes shortened word forms (e.g. abbreviations, acronyms, and initialisms), for DOD and associated military terms.  Although all are shortened versions of a word or phrase, typically by a series of letters, there is a difference.  
a. 
An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase pronounced as a word (e.g., SecDef). 

b. 
An acronym is a shortened form of a phrase of words, where the letters of the acronym stand for the terms of its meaning and is also read as a word (e.g., ASAP [as soon as possible]). 

c. 
An initialism is a shortened form of a word or phrase that is not spoken as a word; each letter is spoken separately (e.g., DOD). 


d. Parenthesis Use After Definitions 
(1) 
The term associated with an abbreviation, acronym, or initialism is referred to as the definition (e.g., the definition for FOUO is ‘for official use only’).  In some cases, there may be another abbreviation, acronym, or initialism in parenthesis following the definition. If the term is associated with a specific organization, the definition will include this tag in parenthesis showing it is an organizational-specific term.  For example: ACE -- 

aviation combat element (USMC) or AFNORTHWEST -- Allied Forces North West Europe (NATO). 

(2) 
There should only be a DOD Dictionary-approved abbreviation, acronym, or initialism in the parenthesis. 


e. Other Criteria for Shortened Word Forms 
The list below is not an exhaustive list of criteria for shortened word forms but is provided as general guidance for organizations in their creation and management. Shortened word forms reflect those used in individual joint doctrine publications. Additional detail on shortened word form construction and guidance may be found in organizational standard operating procedures.  Avoid overuse of shortened word forms. 
(1) 
Must be unclassified and marked as such if in controlled or classified documents.  This means a glossary has to be marked unclassified to have the terms and definitions considered for inclusion in the DOD Dictionary or Terminology Repository. 

(2) Must be more than one letter. 

(3) 
Should avoid duplicating existing shortened word forms and must only have one meaning within a single document.  

(4) Should generally use capital letters. 

(5) 
Should only be created when needed and commonly used.  All terms do no not need a shortened word form.  

(6) 
Establish in a document only when the term is used more than once within the body. 



5. Terminology Repository for DOD (OSD/JS) Issuances 
The Terminology Repository was established to provide awareness on specific and technical policy terms and definitions that reside outside the DOD Dictionary (universal and general terms). The Terminology Repository supports the foundation that the DOD Dictionary is the primary terminology source.  When accessing joint publications or policy, strategy, and planning documents, users should review both the DOD Dictionary and the Terminology Repository to develop a full understanding of how a term may be described, defined, or used to proceed accordingly.  It is also recommended that all glossary developers also use the criteria enumerated in paragraph 2 in maintaining terms and definitions.  Like the DOD Dictionary, the Terminology Repository is unclassified and uncontrolled.  Unlike the DOD Dictionary, the Terminology Repository is not meant to capture or track abbreviations, acronyms, or initialisms.  The Terminology Repository can be found on the Terminology Program webpage at http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/index.html.
